# Data Processing Library

This is an open-source Rust library designed for efficiently processing and analyzing large datasets. The library provides a set of tools and utilities that make it easy to work with various data formats and perform common data processing tasks.

## Key Features

- High-performance data parsing and serialization
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Support for various data formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
- Extensible plugin system

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the library:

```rust
use data_processor::{Dataset, Analysis};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Load dataset from a CSV file
    let dataset = Dataset::from_csv("data.csv")?;
    
    // Perform some analysis
    let analysis = Analysis::new()
        .with_filter(|row| row["value"].as_f64().unwrap() > 10.0)
        .with_groupby("category")
        .with_aggregate("value", Aggregation::Mean);
    
    // Run the analysis
    let results = dataset.analyze(&analysis)?;
    
    // Print results
    println!("{:?}", results);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Load 1GB CSV | 450 | 120 |
| Filter 10M rows | 85 | 45 |
| Group & Aggregate | 120 | 75 |

## Future Development

The library is under active development with plans to add:

1. Support for more file formats
2. Additional statistical analysis tools
3. Improved visualization capabilities
4. Integration with popular ML frameworks
