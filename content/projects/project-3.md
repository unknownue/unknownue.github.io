# Real-Time Object Detection

This project implements a real-time object detection system using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to identify and track various objects in video streams with high accuracy and minimal latency.

## Project Overview

The object detection system uses a custom-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture based on YOLOv5. It's optimized for both accuracy and speed, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices as well as cloud servers.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The model follows a single-stage detection approach:

1. **Backbone Network**: Modified CSPDarknet53 for feature extraction
2. **Neck**: PANet for feature fusion across different scales
3. **Head**: Detection heads for bounding box regression and class prediction

### Training Data

The model was trained on a custom dataset consisting of:
- 15,000 labeled images
- 25 object categories
- Various lighting conditions and scenarios

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| mAP@0.5 | 88.3% |
| FPS (RTX 3080) | 75 |
| FPS (Jetson Nano) | 12 |
| Model Size | 85 MB |

## Sample Code

Here's a snippet showing how to use the model for inference:

```python
import cv2
from detector import ObjectDetector

# Initialize the detector
detector = ObjectDetector(
    model_path="models/yolo_v5_custom.pt",
    confidence=0.4,
    nms_threshold=0.5
)

# Open video stream
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
        
    # Detect objects
    detections = detector.detect(frame)
    
    # Draw bounding boxes
    for det in detections:
        x1, y1, x2, y2, conf, cls_id = det
        label = detector.classes[int(cls_id)]
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (int(x1), int(y1)), (int(x2), int(y2)), (0, 255, 0), 2)
        cv2.putText(frame, f"{label}: {conf:.2f}", (int(x1), int(y1)-10), 
                    cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    
    # Display the result
    cv2.imshow("Object Detection", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:  # ESC key
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
