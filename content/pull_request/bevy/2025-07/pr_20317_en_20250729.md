## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
A regression was introduced in PR #19357 that broke audio playback for entities without `GlobalTransform` components. The root cause was a change to the audio system query that required `GlobalTransform` for all audio entities. This broke non-spatial audio entities that don't require transforms, as they wouldn't match the query. The issue was reported by JC Denton, highlighting that audio playback completely failed for these entities.

### The Solution Approach
The solution involved making the `GlobalTransform` component optional in the audio system query. This maintains the spatial audio functionality introduced in #19357 while restoring compatibility for non-spatial audio. The approach:
1. Changed the query to accept entities with or without `GlobalTransform`
2. Added fallback logic for spatial audio when transform is missing
3. Maintained the existing spatial audio calculations for entities with transforms
4. Added a warning when spatial audio is used without transform

This preserved the benefits of #19357 while fixing the regression.

### The Implementation
The key change was modifying the `play_queued_audio_system` function to handle transform components as optional:

```rust
// File: crates/bevy_audio/src/audio_output.rs

// BEFORE: Required GlobalTransform
for (entity, source_handle, settings, emitter_transform) in &query_nonplaying

// AFTER: Optional GlobalTransform
for (entity, source_handle, settings, maybe_emitter_transform) in &query_nonplaying
```

The spatial audio handling was updated with conditional logic:

```rust
// BEFORE: Direct transform access
let emitter_translation = (emitter_transform.translation() * scale).into();

// AFTER: Conditional handling
let emitter_translation = if let Some(emitter_transform) = maybe_emitter_transform {
    (emitter_transform.translation() * scale).into()
} else {
    warn!("Spatial AudioPlayer with no GlobalTransform component. Using zero.");
    Vec3::ZERO.into()
};
```

### Technical Insights
The solution demonstrates proper handling of optional components in ECS queries:
1. Using `Option<&Component>` in queries allows matching entities with or without the component
2. The fallback to `Vec3::ZERO` ensures spatial calculations don't fail catastrophically
3. The warning helps developers identify misplaced spatial audio entities
4. The fix maintains backward compatibility while preserving new features

### The Impact
This PR:
1. Restores audio playback for non-spatial entities
2. Maintains spatial audio functionality
3. Adds resilience to missing components with clear warnings
4. Resolves a regression with minimal code changes

The changes were verified using the audio examples:
- `audio_control` (non-spatial audio)
- `spatial_audio_2d` (spatial audio)

## Key Files Changed

### crates/bevy_audio/src/audio_output.rs (+10/-3)
**Purpose:** Fix audio playback for entities without transforms  
**Key Changes:**  
1. Made GlobalTransform optional in query  
2. Added fallback for missing transforms  

```rust
// Query modification
Before:
    (Entity, &AudioPlayer<Source>, &PlaybackSettings, &GlobalTransform)

After:
    (Entity, &AudioPlayer<Source>, &PlaybackSettings, Option<&GlobalTransform>)

// Spatial audio handling
Before:
    let emitter_translation = (emitter_transform.translation() * scale).into();

After:
    let emitter_translation = if let Some(emitter_transform) = maybe_emitter_transform {
        (emitter_transform.translation() * scale).into()
    } else {
        warn!("Spatial AudioPlayer with no GlobalTransform component. Using zero.");
        Vec3::ZERO.into()
    };
```
