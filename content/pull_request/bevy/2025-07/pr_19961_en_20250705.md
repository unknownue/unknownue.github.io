#### The Story of This Pull Request
The `access_field` method in Bevy's reflection derive logic had a nested control flow structure that reduced readability. The original implementation used a `match` expression where the `None` arm contained another conditional check. This structure made the logic harder to follow at a glance and added unnecessary cognitive load.

The developer identified this as a code quality improvement opportunity. The solution approach was straightforward: flatten the nested conditionals into a linear sequence of `if let` checks. This maintains identical functionality while improving readability. No alternatives were considered since this was a direct refactor with no behavior changes.

The implementation modified the control flow to check for named fields first, then indexed fields, and finally fall back to a compile error. This linear progression follows the natural order of field access priorities in Rust enums. The change has no performance implications since it only affects code generation during compile time.

This cleanup improves maintainability by making the field access logic more immediately understandable. The change demonstrates how simple structural adjustments can enhance code clarity without altering functionality.

#### Key Files Changed
**File**: `crates/bevy_reflect/derive/src/enum_utility.rs`  
**Changes**: Refactored control flow in field access method  
**Why**: Improve readability by flattening nested conditionals

```rust
// Before:
match &field.field.data.ident {
    Some(field_ident) => {
        let name = field_ident.to_string();
        quote!(#this.field(#name))
    }
    None => {
        if let Some(field_index) = field.field.reflection_index {
            quote!(#this.field_at(#field_index))
        } else {
            quote!(::core::compile_error!(
                "internal bevy_reflect error: field should be active"
            ))
        }
    }
}

// After:
if let Some(field_ident) = &field.field.data.ident {
    let name = field_ident.to_string();
    quote!(#this.field(#name))
} else if let Some(field_index) = field.field.reflection_index {
    quote!(#this.field_at(#field_index))
} else {
    quote!(::core::compile_error!(
        "internal bevy_reflect error: field should be active"
    ))
}
```
