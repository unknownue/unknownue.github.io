## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a small but significant optimization in Bevy's physically-based rendering (PBR) pipeline. The issue was discovered in the shader code responsible for decoding octahedral normals, a technique commonly used in real-time rendering to efficiently store and reconstruct normal vectors. 

The problem centered around the `octahedral_decode` function in the WGSL shader code. This function transforms compressed 2D normal representations back into 3D unit vectors. Analysis revealed that the implementation was performing a redundant normalization operation. The function first called `octahedral_decode_signed` (which already returns a normalized vector) and then applied an additional `normalize()` operation to its result. This double normalization was computationally wasteful since normalization involves expensive operations like square roots and divisions.

The solution was straightforward: remove the redundant normalization step. The modified implementation now directly returns the result from `octahedral_decode_signed`, which is already normalized. This change maintains mathematical correctness while eliminating unnecessary computation. The optimization is particularly valuable in fragment shaders where this function might be executed millions of times per frame.

Performance testing confirmed the improvement. While the gains per individual call are small, they become significant at scale due to the frequency of normal decoding operations in modern rendering pipelines. The change also improves code clarity by removing an unnecessary intermediate variable and operation.

This optimization required no changes to the surrounding code or data structures since it only affects internal implementation details of the decoding algorithm. The modification maintains backward compatibility as the function signature and expected behavior remain unchanged.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/render/utils.wgsl`
**Changes**: Removed redundant normalization step in octahedral normal decoding function  
**Why**: The called function already returns normalized vectors, making additional normalization unnecessary  
**Impact**: Improves shader performance by eliminating expensive normalization operations

```wgsl
// Before:
fn octahedral_decode(v: vec2<f32>) -> vec3<f32> {
    let f = v * 2.0 - 1.0;
    var n = octahedral_decode_signed(f);
    return normalize(n);
}

// After:
fn octahedral_decode(v: vec2<f32>) -> vec3<f32> {
    let f = v * 2.0 - 1.0;
    return octahedral_decode_signed(f);
}
```
