### Description Translation  
**Objective**  

- `bevy_render_macros` fails to build on its own:  
```  
error[E0432]: unresolved import `syn::Pat`

**Solution**  

- Enable the `full` feature of `syn`  

---

### The Story of This Pull Request  

The issue started when `bevy_render_macros` failed to compile independently due to an unresolved import of `syn::Pat`. This occurred because the `Pat` type in the `syn` crate is conditionally compiled behind the `full` feature flag. Without this flag enabled, the required type wasn't available during compilation, causing the build failure.  

The solution was straightforward: enable `syn`'s `full` feature in `bevy_render_macros`'s dependency declaration. This change ensures all necessary types from `syn` are available during compilation, resolving the import error. The fix was minimal—a one-line modification to the Cargo.toml file—but essential for maintaining a working build.  

This change aligns with common practices when using the `syn` crate for procedural macros. The `full` feature is typically required when working with complex macro implementations that need access to all of `syn`'s parsing capabilities. By enabling it, we ensure consistent build behavior and prevent similar issues in future development.

### Key Files Changed  

**File**: `crates/bevy_render/macros/Cargo.toml`  

**Changes**:  
- Enabled `full` feature for `syn` dependency  

**Code Diff**:  
```diff
# crates/bevy_render/macros/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
bevy_macro_utils = { path = "../../bevy_macro_utils", version = "0.17.0-dev" }

-syn = "2.0"
+syn = { version = "2.0", features = ["full"] }
proc-macro2 = "1.0"
quote = "1.0"
```

**Reason**:  
This modification resolves the build error by making `syn::Pat` available during compilation. The `full` feature unlocks all parsing functionality in the `syn` crate, which is necessary for the procedural macros in `bevy_render_macros` to function correctly.
