## Description Translation
# Objective

- Fixes #20181

## Solution

- Stop exposing rodio support of mp3 through minimp3. rodio defaults to symphonia for mp3 now. People who really want an unsecured way to play mp3 that doesn't work in wasm and will get their app rejected from the iOS App Store can still enable it manually by adding a dependency on rodio

## The Story of This Pull Request

The core issue addressed in this PR (#20181) centered around Bevy's continued exposure of the `minimp3` feature for MP3 audio decoding. This dependency had several significant drawbacks that made it unsuitable as a default option. The minimp3 library is no longer actively maintained, contains known security vulnerabilities, doesn't function in WebAssembly environments, and has been known to cause application rejections from the Apple App Store due to its security flaws.

Historically, Bevy's audio system used rodio for audio decoding, which previously relied on minimp3 for MP3 support. However, rodio has since transitioned to using symphonia as its default MP3 decoder. This shift meant that Bevy's continued exposure of minimp3 was redundant and potentially harmful, as it encouraged use of an inferior and insecure decoding option when a better alternative was already available through the same dependency.

The solution implemented was straightforward: completely remove the `minimp3` feature flag from Bevy's public interface. This involved deleting:
1. The feature declaration from Bevy's top-level Cargo.toml
2. The feature mapping in bevy_audio's Cargo.toml
3. The feature exposure in bevy_internal's Cargo.toml
4. The documentation reference in cargo_features.md

Crucially, the standard `mp3` feature remains available and now transparently uses rodio's symphonia backend instead of minimp3. This change maintains MP3 support while removing the problematic minimp3 pathway. For developers who specifically require minimp3 despite its drawbacks (perhaps for compatibility with existing assets or specialized use cases), the PR includes a migration guide explaining how to manually add rodio with minimp3 support:

```toml
[dependencies]
rodio = { version = "0.20", features = ["minimp3"] }
```

This approach balances several technical considerations:
1. Security: Eliminates exposure of a library with known vulnerabilities
2. Maintenance: Reduces Bevy's maintenance surface by removing a deprecated code path
3. Compatibility: Maintains MP3 support through the more robust symphonia backend
4. Flexibility: Allows specialized use cases through direct dependency management

The technical impact is a cleaner dependency tree and more secure defaults. The `minimp3` feature was completely removed from Bevy's public API, meaning projects relying on it will need to either migrate to the standard `mp3` feature or explicitly add rodio with minimp3 support. The migration guide provides clear steps for both paths.

title: Stop exposing mp3 support through minimp3
pull_requests: [20183]
---

The `minimp3` feature is no longer exposed from Bevy. Bevy still supports mp3 through the `mp3` feature.

If you were relying on something specific to `minimp3`, you can still enable it by adding a dependency to `rodio` with the `minimp3` feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
rodio = { version = "0.20", features = ["minimp3"] }
```

This is best to avoid though, as `minimp3` is not actively maintained, doesn't work in wasm, has been known to cause application rejection from the Apple App Store, and has a few security vulnerabilities.
```

**Purpose**: Provides migration instructions for users affected by the removal. Explains how to manually enable minimp3 if absolutely necessary while strongly recommending against it due to security and compatibility concerns.
