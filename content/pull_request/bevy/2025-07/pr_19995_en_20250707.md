# Removing Obsolete Square Root Approximation in Bevy's Shaders

## Basic Information
- **Title**: remove fast_sqrt in favor of sqrt
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19995

## Description Translation
# Objective

- the fast inverse sqrt trick hasnt been useful on modern hardware for over a decade now

## Solution

- just use sqrt, modern hardware has a dedicated instruction which will outperform approximations both in efficiency and accuracy

## Testing

- ran `atmosphere`

## The Story of This Pull Request

### Problem Identification
The Bevy rendering engine contained an optimized `fast_sqrt` function in its WGSL shader math utilities. This function implemented the classic [fast inverse square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root) approximation technique, popularized by Quake III Arena in 1999. The implementation included one Newton-Raphson iteration to improve accuracy:

```wgsl
fn fast_sqrt(x: f32) -> f32 {
    let n = bitcast<f32>(0x1fbd1df5 + (bitcast<i32>(x) >> 1u));
    // One Newton's method iteration for better precision
    return 0.5 * (n + x / n);
}
```

This approximation was historically valuable when square root operations were computationally expensive. However, modern GPU hardware (including all WebGPU-compatible devices) now implements dedicated hardware instructions for square root calculations. These native instructions outperform software approximations in both speed and accuracy.

### Solution Approach
The solution was straightforward: replace all instances of the custom `fast_sqrt` approximation with the built-in `sqrt` function. This approach provides several advantages:

1. **Improved accuracy**: Native hardware implementations provide IEEE-compliant results
2. **Better performance**: Dedicated hardware instructions execute faster than approximation algorithms
3. **Code simplification**: Removes maintenance burden of custom math functions
4. **Consistency**: Aligns with standard WGSL practices

The change required modifying two functions (`fast_acos` and `fast_acos_4`) that previously depended on `fast_sqrt`.

### Implementation Details
The key changes occur in `maths.wgsl`:

1. **Removal of `fast_sqrt`**: The entire custom implementation was deleted
2. **Direct use of `sqrt`**: Both fast_acos functions now directly call the built-in sqrt:

```wgsl
// Before:
res *= fast_sqrt(1.0 - x);

// After:
res *= sqrt(1.0 - x);
```

```wgsl
// Before:
s = fast_sqrt(1.0 - x1) * s;

// After:
s = sqrt(1.0 - x1) * s;
```

### Technical Considerations
The fast inverse square root technique (0x5f3759df) was revolutionary in 1999 when floating-point operations were expensive. Modern GPUs have changed this calculus:

1. **Hardware acceleration**: Modern GPUs implement sqrt as a single instruction
2. **Precision requirements**: Approximations introduce error accumulation
3. **Maintenance cost**: Custom implementations require validation and documentation

The atmosphere example was used for validation since it exercises the modified math functions in a practical rendering context.

### Impact
This change improves both performance and code quality:
- **Performance gain**: Native sqrt instructions typically complete in 1-4 cycles
- **Accuracy improvement**: Reduced error in lighting calculations
- **Code simplification**: 6 lines removed, no functional tradeoffs
- **Modernization**: Aligns with contemporary GPU programming practices
