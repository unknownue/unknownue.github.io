## Description Translation
# Objective

- bevy_log is not "others". it's part of Bevy

## Solution

- Move it
- Also use the same format as other Bevy dependency (path first) as I use it in some regexes to run tests on the repo

## The Story of This Pull Request

The pull request addresses a minor but meaningful inconsistency in dependency management within Bevy's codebase. The core issue centered on how `bevy_log` was categorized and formatted in `bevy_remote`'s Cargo.toml file. 

`bevy_log` is an internal Bevy crate, but it was incorrectly grouped under the "# other" dependencies section alongside truly external crates like `anyhow` and `serde`. This misclassification created inconsistency in how Bevy's own components were organized. More importantly, the dependency specification format didn't match Bevy's standard convention: the `version` field appeared before `path`, whereas other Bevy dependencies consistently placed `path` first.

The developer encountered a practical problem with this inconsistency. Their automated testing workflow used regex patterns that expected the `path` attribute to appear first in Bevy dependency declarations. The existing formatting broke these patterns, making it harder to maintain and run tests efficiently. While not a runtime issue, this affected development workflows and violated consistency principles that help maintain large codebases.

The solution was straightforward but precise: 
1. Move `bevy_log` from the "other dependencies" section to the "Bevy dependencies" section
2. Reformat the dependency declaration to match Bevy's standard pattern with `path` preceding `version`

This change improved the file's organization by correctly categorizing `bevy_log` as an internal component rather than an external dependency. It also aligned the formatting with established conventions used throughout the codebase. The path-first format specifically resolved the author's regex-based tooling issue while creating visual consistency across dependency declarations.

The implementation required minimal changes—just two line modifications in a single file—but demonstrated good attention to detail in maintaining codebase hygiene. The change didn't affect runtime behavior or functionality, but improved maintainability by ensuring:
1. Logical grouping of dependencies
2. Consistent formatting patterns
3. Compatibility with existing development tooling

The rapid merge (within 36 minutes) indicates this was recognized as a clear improvement that aligned with project conventions without introducing any risk.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_remote/Cargo.toml`
This file contained inconsistent dependency categorization and formatting. The changes:
1. Correctly categorize `bevy_log` as a Bevy dependency rather than external
2. Apply consistent path-first formatting to match other Bevy dependencies

**Key modifications:**
```toml
# Before:
# ... other dependencies ...
bevy_log = { version = "0.17.0-dev", path = "../bevy_log" }

# After:
bevy_log = { path = "../bevy_log", version = "0.17.0-dev" }
```
