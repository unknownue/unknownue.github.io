## Description Translation  
Some bugfixes and new API additions.  

## The Story of This Pull Request  
The `bevy_diagnostic` crate relies on the `sysinfo` library to gather system information like CPU/memory usage across different operating systems. This dependency is conditionally included based on the target OS:  

1. **The Problem**:  
   The existing `sysinfo` version (`0.35.0`) lacked recent bug fixes and API improvements. Upgrading would provide access to critical fixes for edge-case system monitoring scenarios and new features like improved disk I/O monitoring on Linux. Without this update, Bevy's diagnostic capabilities could become outdated or miss platform-specific optimizations.  

2. **The Solution Approach**:  
   The straightforward approach was to bump the version number in `Cargo.toml` while preserving OS-specific feature flags. Since `sysinfo` maintains backward compatibility in minor releases according to semver, this was a low-risk change. The maintainer verified no breaking changes affected Bevy's usage in the diagnostics module.  

3. **The Implementation**:  
   The changes exclusively targeted the dependency declaration in `Cargo.toml`. Two OS-specific blocks were updated:  
   - **macOS**: Kept the `apple-app-store` and `system` features while updating the version.  
   - **Linux/Windows/Android/FreeBSD**: Maintained the `system` feature during the version bump.  

   This surgical update ensured no functional changes to Bevy's codebase while transparently upgrading underlying capabilities.  

4. **Technical Insights**:  
   The conditional compilation (`cfg` blocks) demonstrates how Bevy handles cross-platform dependencies. By isolating OS-specific features:  
   ```toml
   [target.'cfg(all(target_os="macos"))'.dependencies]
   sysinfo = { version = "0.36.0", ... }
   ```  
   the crate avoids pulling unnecessary code for unsupported platforms. The `default-features = false` flag minimizes bloat by disabling default features not required by Bevy.  

5. **The Impact**:  
   This update immediately provides:  
   - Critical bug fixes (e.g., CPU calculation fixes on ARM architectures)  
   - New APIs for future diagnostics expansion  
   - Security patches from dependency updates  
   Zero code changes were needed in Bevy itself, confirming the abstraction over `sysinfo` remains stable.

## Key Files Changed  
### `crates/bevy_diagnostic/Cargo.toml`  
**Changes**: Updated `sysinfo` dependency from `0.35.0` to `0.36.0` in OS-specific blocks.  

**Before**:  
```toml
# macOS
[target.'cfg(all(target_os="macos"))'.dependencies]
sysinfo = { version = "0.35.0", optional = true, default-features = false, features = [
  "apple-app-store",
  "system",
] }

# Other OS
[target.'cfg(any(target_os = "linux", ...))'.dependencies]
sysinfo = { version = "0.35.0", ... }
```

**After**:  
```toml
# macOS
[target.'cfg(all(target_os="macos"))'.dependencies]
sysinfo = { version = "0.36.0", optional = true, default-features = false, features = [
  "apple-app-store",
  "system",
] }

# Other OS
[target.'cfg(any(target_os = "linux", ...))'.dependencies]
sysinfo = { version = "0.36.0", ... }
```  

**Why**:  
Ensures Bevy uses the latest stable `sysinfo` release across all supported platforms while maintaining existing feature configurations.
