### Description Translation
**Objective**  
Fix a crash when minimizing a window (#16704). It happens when the window contains a Camera with a custom Viewport.  

**Solution**  
Remove `ExtractedCamera` when the corresponding camera in main world has zero target size. It indicates that the window is minimized.  

**Testing**  
Tested in Windows 11. Previously the split_screen example crashes when the window is minimized; with this change, it no longer crashes. Other behaviors remain unchanged.  

### The Story of This Pull Request

#### The Problem and Context
When minimizing a window containing a camera with a custom viewport, Bevy would crash due to improper handling of zero-sized render targets. This occurred because the camera extraction system didn't account for minimized windows, which have zero physical dimensions. The render pipeline attempted to process cameras with invalid viewport sizes, causing GPU operations to fail. This was particularly problematic for applications using custom viewports that needed to handle window minimization gracefully.

#### The Solution Approach
The fix centers on properly detecting minimized windows and cleaning up associated rendering components. Instead of modifying the rendering pipeline itself, we handle this at the camera extraction stage where we can efficiently detect zero-sized targets. The key insight is that when a camera's target window is minimized (indicated by zero width or height), we should remove all rendering-related components from that camera entity, just as we do for inactive cameras.

#### The Implementation
The solution involves two main changes in the camera extraction system:

1. **Added early exit for zero-sized targets**: When a camera's target size is zero (indicating a minimized window), we remove all rendering components and skip further processing
2. **Refactored component removal**: Introduced a type alias to DRY the component removal logic

Here are the key changes:

```rust
// Before: No handling for zero-sized targets
if let Some(target_size) = camera.physical_target_size() {
    if target_size.x == 0 || target_size.y == 0 {
        continue;
    }
    // ... rest of processing ...
}

// After: Remove components when target size is zero
if let Some(target_size) = camera.physical_target_size() {
    if target_size.x == 0 || target_size.y == 0 {
        commands
            .entity(render_entity)
            .remove::<ExtractedCameraComponents>();
        continue;
    }
    // ... rest of processing ...
}
```

The refactoring introduced a type alias to avoid duplicating the long tuple of components in multiple places:

```rust
// New type alias for component tuple
type ExtractedCameraComponents = (
    ExtractedCamera,
    ExtractedView,
    RenderVisibleEntities,
    TemporalJitter,
    MipBias,
    RenderLayers,
    Projection,
    NoIndirectDrawing,
    ViewUniformOffset,
);

// Unified removal using the alias
commands.entity(render_entity).remove::<ExtractedCameraComponents>();
```

#### Technical Insights
The solution leverages these key technical points:
1. **Window state detection**: Uses `physical_target_size()` as the reliable indicator of minimization state
2. **Component cleanup**: Treats minimized cameras similarly to inactive cameras by removing rendering components
3. **Pipeline safety**: Prevents downstream rendering stages from processing invalid cameras
4. **DRY principle**: The type alias reduces code duplication and maintenance overhead

#### The Impact
This fix:
1. Resolves a crashing bug in window minimization scenarios
2. Maintains consistent behavior between regular and custom-viewport cameras
3. Improves application stability without affecting rendering performance
4. Preserves all existing functionality when windows are in normal state

The changes are localized to the camera extraction system, minimizing risk to other subsystems. Testing confirmed the split_screen example no longer crashes when minimized while maintaining correct rendering behavior when restored.

### Key Files Changed

#### `crates/bevy_render/src/camera.rs`
**Changes**: Added zero-size window handling and refactored component removal  
**Why**: To prevent crashes when minimizing windows with custom viewports  

Key modifications:  
```rust
// Added type alias for component tuple
type ExtractedCameraComponents = (
    ExtractedCamera,
    ExtractedView,
    RenderVisibleEntities,
    TemporalJitter,
    MipBias,
    RenderLayers,
    Projection,
    NoIndirectDrawing,
    ViewUniformOffset,
);

// Before (inactive camera handling):
if !camera.is_active {
    commands.entity(render_entity).remove::<( ... long tuple ... )>();
    continue;
}

// After (using type alias):
if !camera.is_active {
    commands.entity(render_entity).remove::<ExtractedCameraComponents>();
    continue;
}

// New minimization handling:
if let Some(target_size) = camera.physical_target_size() {
    if target_size.x == 0 || target_size.y == 0 {
        commands.entity(render_entity).remove::<ExtractedCameraComponents>();
        continue;
    }
    // ... rest of processing ...
}
```
