## Title: Fixing Visibility Handling in Solari's ReSTIR DI Implementation

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Fix visibility (re)use in Solari DI
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20113
- **Author**: JMS55
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Labels**: D-Trivial, A-Rendering, S-Ready-For-Final-Review

## Description Translation
**Objective**
Fixes the re(use) of visibility in Solari's ReSTIR DI. 

The paper I based things off of didn't (seem) to use visibility in their resampling https://yusuketokuyoshi.com/papers/2024/Efficient_Visibility_Reuse_for_Real-time_ReSTIR_(Supplementary_Document).pdf, only shading, but factoring it into the resampling improves things a lot.

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
The PR addresses incorrect visibility handling in Solari's ReSTIR DI (Direct Illumination) implementation. The original implementation applied visibility too early in the sampling pipeline - during initial reservoir generation. This conflicted with the reference paper's approach which only applied visibility during shading, not resampling. The premature visibility application caused suboptimal sample weighting during spatio-temporal reuse, resulting in noisy renders with visible artifacts.

### The Solution Approach
The solution relocates visibility application from the reservoir generation phase to the target function evaluation phase. This aligns with the observation that factoring visibility into resampling significantly improves results. The implementation:
1. Removes visibility multiplication during initial reservoir generation
2. Applies visibility when calculating the target function
3. Fixes neighbor pixel ID calculation to use floating-point precision

### The Implementation
The changes are minimal but impactful. In `restir_di.wgsl`, visibility multiplication was removed from reservoir generation and added to the target function:

```wgsl
// Before reservoir generation:
reservoir.unbiased_contribution_weight *= reservoir.visibility;

// After removal:
```

```wgsl
// Before target function:
let light_contribution = calculate_light_contribution(...).radiance;

// After target function:
let light_contribution = calculate_light_contribution(...).radiance * reservoir.visibility;
```

This change ensures visibility is considered during reservoir merging and resampling operations. Additionally, neighbor pixel selection was updated to use floating-point math for better precision:

```wgsl
// Before:
var spatial_id = vec2<i32>(center_pixel_id) + vec2<i32>(sample_disk(...));
spatial_id = clamp(spatial_id, vec2(0i), vec2<i32>(view.viewport.zw) - 1i);

// After:
var spatial_id = vec2<f32>(center_pixel_id) + sample_disk(...);
spatial_id = clamp(spatial_id, vec2(0.0), view.viewport.zw - 1.0);
```

### Technical Insights
The key insight is that visibility should be part of the target function evaluation rather than applied prematurely to reservoir weights. This allows the resampling algorithm to properly weight samples based on both their radiance contribution and visibility. The floating-point fix in neighbor selection prevents integer truncation errors during spatial reuse.

### The Impact
The changes significantly improve rendering quality by:
1. Reducing noise in shadowed areas
2. Improving sample weighting during spatio-temporal reuse
3. Fixing precision issues in neighbor selection
The before/after images demonstrate substantially cleaner results with better shadow definition and reduced artifacts. The solution maintains real-time performance while improving visual quality.
