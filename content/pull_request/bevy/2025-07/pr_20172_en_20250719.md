## Change flattened dependency graph from `DiGraph<NodeId>` to `DiGraph<SystemKey>`

### Basic Information
- **Title**: Change flattened dependency graph from `DiGraph<NodeId>` to `DiGraph<SystemKey>`
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20172
- **Author**: ItsDoot
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Labels**: A-ECS, C-Code-Quality, S-Ready-For-Final-Review, D-Modest
- **Created**: 2025-07-17T06:48:14Z
- **Merged**: 2025-07-19T06:24:41Z
- **Merged By**: alice-i-cecile

### Description
**Objective**
- Part of #20115

Semantically, the fully flattened dependency graph never contains `SystemSetKey`s, so let's encode that into its type.

**Solution**
- Added `GraphNodeId` trait.
- Generalized `DiGraph` and `UnGraph` with a new `GraphNodeId` `N` type parameter.
- Generalized most functions involving `DiGraph`/`UnGraph` to take a `GraphNodeId` type parameter.
- Added `Graph::try_into` function to help convert from `DiGraph<NodeId>` to `DiGraph<SystemKey>`.

**Testing**
Re-using current tests.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a type inconsistency in Bevy's ECS scheduler. The flattened dependency graph, which represents execution order after resolving system sets, should only contain systems. However, it was previously represented as a `DiGraph<NodeId>`, where `NodeId` could represent either systems or sets. This created a semantic mismatch since sets shouldn't exist in the flattened graph.

The solution introduces a `GraphNodeId` trait to abstract over node types. This allows the graph structures to be generic over the node type. The key changes are:

1. `DiGraph` and `UnGraph` now take a type parameter `N` implementing `GraphNodeId`
2. `NodeId` and `SystemKey` both implement `GraphNodeId` with different compact storage types
3. A new `try_into` method converts graphs between node types
4. The flattened graph in schedule building is now explicitly `DiGraph<SystemKey>`

The implementation required updating multiple schedule-building passes to handle the new graph type. Most notably, the `AutoInsertApplyDeferredPass` now stores `SystemKey` references instead of `NodeId` in its internal state. The graph conversion happens in `ScheduleGraph::get_dependency_flattened`, where we convert the hierarchy-resolved graph to a system-only representation.

```rust
// In ScheduleGraph::get_dependency_flattened
dependency_flattening
    .try_into::<SystemKey>()
    .unwrap_or_else(|n| {
        unreachable!("Flattened graph has leftover set: {}", ...)
    })
```

This change improves type safety by enforcing the invariant that flattened graphs only contain systems. It eliminates runtime checks for node types and makes the code more semantically correct. The performance impact is minimal since the conversion happens once during schedule initialization.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/graph/graph_map.rs` (+98/-153)
Generalized graph structures to be generic over node types. Added graph conversion via `try_into`.

```rust
pub struct Graph<const DIRECTED: bool, N: GraphNodeId, S = FixedHasher> {
    nodes: IndexMap<N, Vec<N::Adjacent>, S>,
    edges: HashSet<N::Edge, S>,
}

pub fn try_into<T: GraphNodeId + TryFrom<N>>(self) -> Result<Graph<DIRECTED, T, S>, T::Error> {
    // Conversion logic between node types
}
```

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/node.rs` (+186/-2)
Implemented `GraphNodeId` for `NodeId` and `SystemKey`. Defined compact storage types.

```rust
pub trait GraphNodeId: Copy + Eq + Hash + Ord + Debug {
    type Adjacent: ...;
    type Edge: ...;
}

impl GraphNodeId for NodeId {
    type Adjacent = CompactNodeIdAndDirection;
    type Edge = CompactNodeIdPair;
}
```

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/schedule.rs` (+71/-62)
Updated schedule building to use `DiGraph<SystemKey>` for flattened graphs.

```rust
fn get_dependency_flattened(...) -> DiGraph<SystemKey> {
    let dependency_flattening = ...; // NodeId-based graph
    dependency_flattening.try_into().unwrap()
}
```

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/graph/tarjan_scc.rs` (+35/-23)
Made Tarjan's algorithm generic over node types.

```rust
pub(crate) fn new_tarjan_scc<N: GraphNodeId, S: BuildHasher>(
    graph: &DiGraph<N, S>,
) -> impl Iterator<Item = SmallVec<[N; 4]>> + '_ { ... }
```

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/auto_insert_apply_deferred.rs` (+21/-34)
Updated to work with `DiGraph<SystemKey>` and store `SystemKey` references.

```rust
pub struct AutoInsertApplyDeferredPass {
    auto_sync_node_ids: HashMap<u32, SystemKey>, // Changed from NodeId
}

fn build(... dependency_flattened: &mut DiGraph<SystemKey>) { ... }
```
