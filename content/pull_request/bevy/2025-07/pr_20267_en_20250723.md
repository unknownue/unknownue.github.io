## Improve `bevy_a11y` docs

### Basic Information
- **Title**: Improve `bevy_a11y` docs
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20267
- **Author**: onkoe
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Labels**: C-Docs, A-Accessibility, S-Ready-For-Final-Review
- **Created**: 2025-07-23T18:54:13Z
- **Merged**: 2025-07-23T19:44:06Z
- **Merged By**: alice-i-cecile

### Description
The documentation for this crate has always been a bit scarce.

I did my best at adding some additional context and explanations to the module. 

## Changes

Here's a lil summary of what I did:

- Change the module's headline/header to say: "Reusable accessibility primitives"
    - This could help newer users understand what the crate does, particularly when seeing it in the "modules" list in the top-level `bevy` crate.
    - In the `bevy` crate's modules list, it'll appear like:
    	- `a11y`: Reusable accessibility primitives
    - If you have a better idea for it, please feel free to suggest it here!
- Add more mod-level documentation
	- I wanted to make it more clear to users when/where they'd use this module.
	- Also, it's nice to know _why_ the `accesskit` re-export was removed, so I added that in as a footnote.
- Gave a visual, ultra-clear explainer on `AccessibilityNode`, stating that `AccessKit`'s tree is NOT Bevy's ECS
- Improve clarity on ty-level docs
	- Mostly helps to say why each type exists.
- Also snuck in some basic grammar improvements... when useful.

## For Reviewers

A quick fact-check of the new docs would be really helpful. If anything is unclear, questionable, or just plain incorrect, please let me know so I can fix it. :)

Thank you!

### The Story of This Pull Request
The `bevy_a11y` crate had sparse documentation that didn't clearly explain its purpose or usage. Users, especially newcomers, struggled to understand when to use the crate and how its components interacted with Bevy's architecture. The existing documentation also didn't clarify why `accesskit` was no longer re-exported, leading to confusion about dependency management.

The solution focused on comprehensive documentation improvements. The module header was changed to "Reusable accessibility primitives" to immediately communicate the crate's purpose. This gives users clear context when browsing Bevy's module list. The module-level documentation was expanded to explain:
- The crate's role in accessibility integration
- How the `AccessibilityPlugin` bridges `AccessKit` with Bevy's ECS
- When different users (binary authors vs library maintainers) should interact with the crate
- Why `accesskit` is no longer re-exported (to prevent confusion with Bevy UI nodes)

Type-level documentation received significant enhancements. For `ActionRequest`, the docs now clarify it's a newtype wrapper enabling `accesskit::ActionRequest` to function as a Bevy event. The `AccessibilityRequested` resource documentation explains it tracks whether assistive technologies are active and controls accessibility update flow. Similarly, `ManageAccessibilityUpdates` now explicitly states it determines whether Bevy's ECS should handle accessibility tree updates, preventing conflicts with external GUI libraries.

The most critical improvement was for `AccessibilityNode`. The new documentation provides a visual explanation of how these components map to `AccessKit`'s tree structure while emphasizing this tree is separate from Bevy's ECS hierarchy. Clear examples show:
- How parent-child relationships work when both entities have `AccessibilityNode`
- The fallback behavior when parent entities lack this component (nodes attach to primary window)
- Why this distinction matters for accessibility tree construction

The `AccessibilityPlugin` docs were updated to clarify its role in initializing resources without handling GUI aspects. Throughout the documentation, grammar and clarity improvements were made while preserving technical accuracy. No functional changes were made to the code - this PR solely improves documentation quality.

These changes help users understand:
1. When to use `bevy_a11y` versus other accessibility solutions
2. How to properly structure accessibility nodes in their ECS hierarchy
3. How to avoid dependency conflicts when using `accesskit` directly
4. How accessibility resources interact during runtime

### Key Files Changed
**crates/bevy_a11y/src/lib.rs**  
Modified header and added comprehensive module documentation:  
```rust
// Before:
//! Accessibility for Bevy
//!
//! As of Bevy version 0.15 `accesskit` is no longer re-exported from this crate.
//!
//! If you need to use `accesskit`, you will need to add it as a separate dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! Make sure to use the same version of `accesskit` as Bevy.

// After:
//! Reusable accessibility primitives
//!
//! This crate provides accessibility integration for the engine. It exposes the
//! [`AccessibilityPlugin`]. This plugin integrates `AccessKit`, a Rust crate
//! providing OS-agnostic accessibility primitives, with Bevy's ECS.
//!
//! ## Some notes on utility
//!
//! While this crate defines useful types for accessibility, it does not
//! actually power accessibility features in Bevy.
//!
//! Instead, it helps other interfaces coordinate their approach to
//! accessibility. Binary authors should add the [`AccessibilityPlugin`], while
//! library maintainers may use the [`AccessibilityRequested`] and
//! [`ManageAccessibilityUpdates`] resources.
```

Enhanced `AccessibilityNode` documentation with tree structure explanation:  
```rust
// Before:
/// Component to wrap a [`accesskit::Node`], representing this entity to the platform's
/// accessibility API.
///
/// If an entity has a parent, and that parent also has an `AccessibilityNode`,
/// the entity's node will be a child of the parent's node.
///
/// If the entity doesn't have a parent, or if the immediate parent doesn't have
/// an `AccessibilityNode`, its node will be an immediate child of the primary window.

// After:
/// Represents an entity to `AccessKit` through an [`accesskit::Node`].
///
/// Platform-specific accessibility APIs utilize `AccessKit` nodes in their
/// accessibility frameworks. So, this component acts as a translation between
/// "Bevy entity" and "platform-agnostic accessibility element".
///
/// ## Organization in the `AccessKit` Accessibility Tree
///
/// `AccessKit` allows users to form a "tree of nodes" providing accessibility
/// information. That tree is **not** Bevy's ECS!
///
/// To explain, let's say this component is added to an entity, `E`.
///
/// ### Parent and Child
///
/// If `E` has a parent, `P`, and `P` also has this `AccessibilityNode`
/// component, then `E`'s `AccessKit` node will be a child of `P`'s `AccessKit`
/// node.
///
/// Resulting `AccessKit` tree:
/// - P
///     - E
