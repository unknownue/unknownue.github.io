## Description Translation
# Objective

- Progress towards #19887.

## Solution

- Convert FromWorld impls to systems in `RenderStartup`.
- Use a closure system for initializing `ResourceManager` to capture the `cluster_buffer_slots`.

## Testing

- Ran the `meshlet` example and it behaves the same as main.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses the initialization pattern for meshlet-related resources in Bevy's rendering pipeline. The core issue was that several critical resources were being initialized using Bevy's `FromWorld` trait, which creates resources directly from the world state. While functional, this approach has limitations in terms of system ordering and resource dependencies.

The solution converts these `FromWorld` implementations into systems scheduled in `RenderStartup`, Bevy's designated schedule for one-time render initialization tasks. This change improves consistency with Bevy's ECS patterns and allows for better control over initialization order.

For the `ResourceManager` initialization, we needed to preserve the `cluster_buffer_slots` configuration value from the plugin. This was achieved using a closure system that captures the value at system creation time, maintaining the necessary configuration while fitting into the ECS paradigm.

The GPU feature check was also moved into a dedicated system within `RenderStartup`. This ensures the check runs at the appropriate time in the initialization sequence, providing early feedback for unsupported hardware configurations.

Implementation-wise, the changes required refactoring three main resources:
1. `MeshletMeshManager` initialization converted to `init_meshlet_mesh_manager` system
2. `MeshletPipelines` initialization converted to `init_meshlet_pipelines` system
3. `ResourceManager` initialization converted to a closure-based system

These systems are now chained together in `RenderStartup` with explicit ordering:
1. GPU feature check (`check_meshlet_features`)
2. ResourceManager initialization
3. Pipelines initialization
4. Mesh manager initialization

The migration guide was updated to reflect that these resources are now initialized in `RenderStartup`, helping users understand the new initialization sequence.

Testing confirmed the `meshlet` example behaves identically to main, validating that the resource initialization changes didn't introduce functional regressions.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/meshlet/meshlet_mesh_manager.rs`
- Replaced `FromWorld` implementation with a command-based initialization system
- The system creates the resource using the render device directly from ECS resources

```rust
// Before:
impl FromWorld for MeshletMeshManager {
    fn from_world(world: &mut World) -> Self {
        let render_device = world.resource::<RenderDevice>();
        Self { /* ... */ }
    }
}

// After:
pub fn init_meshlet_mesh_manager(mut commands: Commands, render_device: Res<RenderDevice>) {
    commands.insert_resource(MeshletMeshManager {
        vertex_positions: PersistentGpuBuffer::new("meshlet_vertex_positions", &render_device),
        // ... other buffers ...
    });
}
```

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/meshlet/mod.rs`
- Reorganized initialization into `RenderStartup` systems
- Added GPU feature check system
- Used closure system to capture `cluster_buffer_slots`
- Removed direct resource initialization in plugin setup

```rust
// Added system for feature checking
fn check_meshlet_features(render_device: Res<RenderDevice>) {
    if !features.contains(MeshletPlugin::required_wgpu_features()) {
        error!("Missing required features");
        std::process::exit(1);
    }
}

// Closure system for ResourceManager
let cluster_buffer_slots = self.cluster_buffer_slots;
let init_resource_manager_system = 
    move |mut commands: Commands, render_device: Res<RenderDevice>| {
        commands.insert_resource(ResourceManager::new(cluster_buffer_slots, &render_device));
    };

// Systems added to RenderStartup
render_app.add_systems(
    RenderStartup,
    (
        check_meshlet_features,
        (
            (init_resource_manager_system, init_meshlet_pipelines).chain(),
            init_meshlet_mesh_manager,
        ),
    ).chain(),
)
```

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/meshlet/pipelines.rs`
- Converted `FromWorld` implementation to command-based initialization system
- The system queues pipelines and inserts the resource when complete

```rust
// Before:
impl FromWorld for MeshletPipelines {
    fn from_world(world: &mut World) -> Self {
        let resource_manager = world.resource::<ResourceManager>();
        // ... complex pipeline creation ...
    }
}

// After:
pub fn init_meshlet_pipelines(
    mut commands: Commands,
    resource_manager: Res<ResourceManager>,
    // ... other dependencies ...
) {
    // ... pipeline creation logic ...
    commands.insert_resource(MeshletPipelines {
        clear_visibility_buffer: pipeline_cache.queue_compute_pipeline(/* ... */),
        // ... other pipelines ...
    });
}
```

### `release-content/migration-guides/render_startup.md`
- Added documentation for meshlet resources now initialized in `RenderStartup`

```markdown
- `MeshletPipelines`
- `MeshletMeshManager`
- `ResourceManager`
```
