### bevy_math: don't allow dead code

#### Basic Information
- **Title**: bevy_math: don't allow dead code
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20039
- **Author**: mockersf
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Labels**: D-Trivial, C-Code-Quality, S-Ready-For-Final-Review, A-Math
- **Created**: 2025-07-08T17:30:01Z
- **Merged**: 2025-07-08T18:05:41Z
- **Merged By**: alice-i-cecile

#### Description Translation
# Objective

- `bevy_math` allows the `dead_code` lint on some private structs when `alloc` is not enabled
- allowing lints is not allowed, we should use expect

## Solution

- Don't even compile the code if its expected to be dead instead of allowing or expecting the lint

---

### The Story of This Pull Request

The polygon triangulation implementation in `bevy_math` contained several structures and functions that were only relevant when the `alloc` feature was enabled. Originally, the code used `#[cfg_attr]` with `allow(dead_code)` or `expect(dead_code)` to suppress compiler warnings for these unused items when `alloc` was disabled. However, this approach violated Bevy's lint policy which prohibits blanket lint allowances.

The core issue was that conditional compilation wasn't properly scoped. Structures like `SweepLineEvent`, `Segment`, and their associated implementations were still being compiled when `alloc` was disabled, triggering dead code warnings. Since these components were inherently tied to heap-allocated data structures (like `BTreeMap` and `Vec`), they served no purpose without the `alloc` feature.

The solution involved replacing lint suppression with proper conditional compilation. By adding `#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]` directly to:
1. Type definitions (`Endpoint`, `SweepLineEvent`, `Segment`)
2. Trait implementations (`PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`)
3. Helper functions (`xy_order`)
4. The `SweepLine` struct itself

The code is now completely omitted from compilation when `alloc` isn't enabled. This eliminates the dead code warnings at their source rather than suppressing them after the fact. The changes maintain identical functionality when `alloc` is enabled while reducing compiler noise and adhering to project lint policies in disabled configurations.

#### Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_math/src/primitives/polygon.rs**  
Replaced lint allowances with conditional compilation:

```rust
// Before:
#[cfg_attr(
    not(feature = "alloc"),
    expect(dead_code, reason = "this type is only used with the alloc feature")
)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum Endpoint { ... }

// After:
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]
enum Endpoint { ... }
```

```rust
// Before:
#[cfg_attr(
    not(feature = "alloc"),
    allow(dead_code, reason = "this type is only used with the alloc feature")
)]
struct SweepLineEvent { ... }

// After:
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]
struct SweepLineEvent { ... }
```

```rust
// Before:
#[cfg_attr(
    not(feature = "alloc"),
    allow(dead_code, reason = "this type is only used with the alloc feature")
)]
fn xy_order(a: Vec2, b: Vec2) -> Ordering { ... }

// After:
#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]
fn xy_order(a: Vec2, b: Vec2) -> Ordering { ... }
```
