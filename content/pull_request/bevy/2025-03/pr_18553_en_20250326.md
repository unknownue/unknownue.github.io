# #18553 Use current_exe for default window title

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Use current_exe for default window title
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18553
- **Author**: IceSentry
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Labels**: `A-Windowing`, `C-Usability`, `S-Ready-For-Final-Review`, `D-Straightforward`
- **Created**: 2025-03-26T00:37:46Z
- **Merged**: Not merged
- **Merged By**: N/A

## Description Translation
# Objective

- We currently default to "App" for the window title, it would be nice if examples had more descriptive names

## Solution

- Use `std::env::current_exe` to try to figure out a default title. If it's not present. Use "App".

## Testing

- I tested that examples that set a custom title still use the custom title and that examples without a custom title use the example name

### Notes

Here's a previous attempt at this from a few years ago https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3404

There's some relevant discussion in there, but cart's decision was to default to "App" when no name was found.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a long-standing usability issue in Bevy's windowing system where all applications defaulted to "App" as their window title. While functional, this generic title provided poor visibility in development environments and made example differentiation difficult. The core challenge was to derive a meaningful default title without introducing breaking changes or complex configuration.

The solution leverages Rust's standard library capabilities through `std::env::current_exe()` to extract the executable name when available. This approach balances simplicity with effectiveness, using existing platform APIs rather than introducing new dependencies. The implementation carefully handles edge cases through a fallback chain:

1. Attempt to get the current executable path
2. Extract the file stem (name without extension)
3. Fall back to "App" if any step fails

Key code changes appear in the `DEFAULT_WINDOW_TITLE` initialization:

```rust
static DEFAULT_WINDOW_TITLE: LazyLock<String> = LazyLock::new(|| {
    #[cfg(feature = "std")]
    {
        std::env::current_exe()
            .ok()
            .and_then(|current_exe| Some(format!("{}", current_exe.file_stem()?.to_string_lossy())))
            .unwrap_or_else(|| "App".to_owned())
    }

    #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
    {
        "App".to_owned()
    }
});
```

This implementation demonstrates several engineering considerations:
- Maintains compatibility with `no_std` environments through feature gating
- Uses lazy initialization to avoid unnecessary computation
- Preserves existing behavior as a fallback
- Handles filesystem errors gracefully through `ok()` and `unwrap_or_else`

The changes particularly benefit example projects, where window titles now automatically reflect the example name. Testing confirmed that explicit title settings override this default, preserving backward compatibility. The PR references historical context from #3404, showing evolution in the approach while respecting previous design decisions.

## Key Files Changed

### File: `crates/bevy_window/src/window.rs`
1. **Change**: Modified default window title logic to use executable name
2. **Code Before**:
```rust
static DEFAULT_WINDOW_TITLE: LazyLock<String> = LazyLock::new(|| {
    "App".to_owned()
});
```
3. **Code After**:
```rust
static DEFAULT_WINDOW_TITLE: LazyLock<String> = LazyLock::new(|| {
    #[cfg(feature = "std")]
    {
        std::env::current_exe()
            .ok()
            .and_then(|current_exe| Some(format!("{}", current_exe.file_stem()?.to_string_lossy())))
            .unwrap_or_else(|| "App".to_owned())
    }

    #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
    {
        "App".to_owned()
    }
});
```
4. **Impact**: Enables automatic descriptive titles while maintaining backward compatibility
