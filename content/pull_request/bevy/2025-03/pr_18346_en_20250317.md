# #18346 bevy_winit: Create the window initially invisible as required by AccessKit

## Basic Information
- **Title**: bevy_winit: Create the window initially invisible as required by AccessKit
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18346
- **Author**: mwcampbell
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Created**: 2025-03-16T20:40:45Z

## Description Translation
The initial `with_visible` call was intended to do this, but that was undone by a later `with_visible` call.

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
The PR addresses an accessibility compliance issue in Bevy's window initialization. AccessKit, Bevy's accessibility integration, requires windows to be created initially invisible to properly initialize accessibility trees before visual presentation. However, the existing window creation flow in `bevy_winit` contained conflicting visibility settings:

1. An initial `with_visible(false)` call intended to hide the window
2. A subsequent `with_visible(true)` call that prematurely made it visible

This sequence caused a visible window flash and violated AccessKit's initialization requirements, potentially breaking accessibility features for users relying on screen readers.

### The Solution Approach
The fix focuses on maintaining consistent visibility state throughout window creation:
1. Remove the conflicting `with_visible(true)` call
2. Preserve the initial `with_visible(false)` configuration
3. Rely on Bevy's existing window visibility management to show the window when appropriate

This approach aligns with winit's recommended practices for accessibility integration while maintaining existing Bevy window behavior for most users.

### The Implementation
The critical change occurs in the window builder configuration within `winit_windows.rs`:

```rust
// Before:
let window = {
    let mut window = WindowBuilder::new()
        .with_title(window.title.clone())
        .with_visible(false); // Initial visibility set to false
    // ... other configuration
    window = window.with_visible(true); // Overriding visibility
    window.build(event_loop).unwrap()
};

// After:
let window = WindowBuilder::new()
    .with_title(window.title.clone())
    .with_visible(false) // Visibility remains false
    // ... other configuration
    .build(event_loop)
    .unwrap();
```

The removal of the second `with_visible(true)` call ensures the window remains hidden during initialization while preserving other window attributes. This change doesn't affect the eventual window visibility - Bevy's existing systems still control when the window becomes visible to users through its standard visibility management.

### Technical Insights
Key technical considerations:
1. **Window Lifecycle Management**: Bevy uses separate systems for window creation and presentation timing
2. **Accessibility Integration**: AccessKit requires complete accessibility tree initialization before visual presentation
3. **Platform Consistency**: Winit's window visibility behavior varies across platforms, making explicit control critical

The solution maintains platform-agnostic behavior while satisfying accessibility requirements through:
- Early accessibility tree construction
- Deferred visual presentation
- Preservation of existing visibility control systems

### The Impact
This change:
1. Enables proper AccessKit initialization for accessibility tools
2. Eliminates visible window flashes during startup
3. Maintains backward compatibility with existing Bevy applications
4. Reduces rendering overhead during initial setup

The fix demonstrates the importance of coordinating low-level window management with accessibility requirements, particularly in game engines where visual presentation timing is critical.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_winit/src/winit_windows.rs` (+8/-2)
**Purpose**: Fix window visibility sequence during creation

Key modification:
```rust
// Before (simplified):
let mut window = WindowBuilder::new()
    .with_visible(false)
    // ... other settings
    .with_visible(true);  // Visibility override

// After:
let window = WindowBuilder::new()
    .with_visible(false)
    // ... other settings (no visibility override);
```

The change removes the redundant visibility override while maintaining the initial hidden state. This aligns with AccessKit's requirements without altering Bevy's public API or standard window management behavior.
