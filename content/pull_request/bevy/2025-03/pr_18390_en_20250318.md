## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a build system issue caused by circular dependencies introduced through an example implementation. The core problem stemmed from the `bevy_platform_support` crate's examples creating a dependency chain that violated module isolation principles.

In Rust projects, circular dependencies prevent successful compilation by creating unresolvable module references. The problematic example in `collections.rs` appears to have created a situation where:

1. The example depended on parent crate features
2. Those features themselves depended on other crates
3. The dependency chain ultimately looped back to `bevy_platform_support`

This manifested as compiler errors during project builds, particularly affecting developers working with the example system. The author identified two potential solutions:

1. Restructuring dependencies (as attempted in #18389)
2. Removing the problematic example entirely

The chosen solution prioritizes build reliability over preserving a non-essential example. By completely removing the `collections.rs` example and its associated Cargo.toml references, the PR:

- Eliminates the circular dependency at its source
- Maintains crate functionality for primary use cases
- Simplifies the project's dependency graph

The implementation required surgical removal of 17 lines from the collections example and 3 lines from the Cargo.toml manifest. This demonstrates an important principle in dependency management: sometimes the most straightforward solution to circular dependencies is removing non-critical components that introduce complex relationships.
