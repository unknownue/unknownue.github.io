## English

### Description Translation
# Objective

Component `require()` IDE integration became completely broken after #16575.

# Solution

This reverts us back to the previous implementation of putting docs on the Component trait directly. While this slightly reduces the discoverability of required components in Rust documentation, the complete loss of IDE support for required components wasn't worth the marginal documentation improvements.

Additionally, with Rust Analyzer now including derive attributes in suggestions, we retain the benefits of procedural macro attributes without the IDE integration costs.
