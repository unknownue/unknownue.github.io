# #18635 Delete unused weak handle and remove duplicate loads.

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Delete unused weak handle and remove duplicate loads.
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18635
- **Author**: andriyDev

- **Created**: 2025-03-30T23:43:25Z
- **Merged**: Not merged

## Description Translation
# Objective

- Cleanup

## Solution

- Remove completely unused weak_handle (`MESH_PREPROCESS_TYPES_SHADER_HANDLE`). This value is not used directly, and is never populated.
- Delete multiple loads of `BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE`. We load it three times right after one another. This looks to be a copy-paste error.

## Testing

- None.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses two distinct but related code quality issues in Bevy's rendering infrastructure. The changes focus on eliminating dead code and redundant operations in the GPU preprocessing system, specifically within the `gpu_preprocess.rs` file.

**The Problem and Context**  
The first issue stemmed from an unused weak handle `MESH_PREPROCESS_TYPES_SHADER_HANDLE` that existed in the codebase. Weak handles in Bevy's asset system (Handles débiles) are typically used for indirect references to assets, but this particular instance wasn't being populated or referenced anywhere in the code. Such dead code adds unnecessary complexity and potential confusion for maintainers.

The second issue involved redundant loading of the `BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE` asset. The original code contained three consecutive calls to load this same shader handle:

```rust
let build_indirect_params_shader = shaders.get(
    &BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE.typed::<Shader>()
);
// ...later in the same function...
let build_indirect_params_shader = shaders.get(
    &BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE.typed::<Shader>()
);
// ...and again...
let build_indirect_params_shader = shaders.get(
    &BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE.typed::<Shader>()
);
```

This pattern suggested a copy-paste error where the same loading operation was accidentally duplicated multiple times without any functional purpose.

**The Solution Approach**  
For the unused weak handle, the solution was straightforward deletion since no code paths depended on it. For the redundant loads, the fix involved identifying all duplicate instances and removing them while preserving one valid load operation.

**Technical Insights**  
The changes demonstrate two important principles in asset management:
1. **Weak Handle Lifecycles**: Weak handles (poignées faibles) require explicit population to be useful. The removed handle never went through this population process, making it effectively dead code.
2. **Asset Loading Efficiency**: While redundant loading calls don't necessarily cause runtime errors in Bevy's asset system (due to internal caching), they add unnecessary overhead in terms of:
   - Hash map lookups
   - Error checking redundancy
   - Code maintenance complexity

**The Impact**  
These changes improve code quality by:
1. Reducing cognitive load for developers reading the code
2. Eliminating unnecessary system operations
3. Removing potential points of confusion during future modifications
4. Decreasing the overall codebase size (15 lines removed)

The PR serves as a good example of proactive codebase maintenance, showing how regular audits can catch subtle issues that accumulate over time.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/render/gpu_preprocess.rs` (+0/-15)
**Changes:**
1. Removed unused `MESH_PREPROCESS_TYPES_SHADER_HANDLE` definition
2. Eliminated duplicate `BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE` loads

**Before:**
```rust
pub const MESH_PREPROCESS_TYPES_SHADER_HANDLE: Handle<Shader> = 
    Handle::weak_from_u128(253741140527605170);

// Multiple instances of:
let build_indirect_params_shader = shaders.get(
    &BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE.typed::<Shader>()
);
```

**After:**
```rust
// MESH_PREPROCESS_TYPES_SHADER_HANDLE completely removed

// Single remaining instance:
let build_indirect_params_shader = shaders.get(
    &BUILD_INDIRECT_PARAMS_SHADER_HANDLE.typed::<Shader>()
);
```
