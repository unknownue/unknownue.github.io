# #17955 Add `no_std` support to `bevy`

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Add `no_std` support to `bevy`
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17955
- **Author**: bushrat011899
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Created**: 2025-02-20T23:15:40Z
- **Merged**: Not merged
- **Merged By**: N/A

## Description Translation
# Objective

- Fixes #15460 (will open new issues for further `no_std` efforts)
- Supersedes #17715

## Solution

- Threaded in new features as required
- Made certain crates optional but default enabled
- Removed `compile-check-no-std` from internal `ci` tool since GitHub CI can now simply check `bevy` itself now
- Added CI task to check `bevy` on `thumbv6m-none-eabi` to ensure `portable-atomic` support is still valid [^1]

[^1]: This may be controversial, since it could be interpreted as implying Bevy will maintain support for `thumbv6m-none-eabi` going forward. In reality, just like `x86_64-unknown-none`, this is a [canary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine) target to make it clear when `portable-atomic` no longer works as intended (fixing atomic support on atomically challenged platforms). If a PR comes through and makes supporting this class of platforms impossible, then this CI task can be removed. I however wager this won't be a problem.

## Testing

- CI

## Release Notes

Bevy now has support for `no_std` directly from the `bevy` crate.

Users can disable default features and enable a new `default_no_std` feature instead, allowing `bevy` to be used in `no_std` applications and libraries.

```toml
# Bevy for `no_std` platforms
bevy = { version = "0.16", default-features = false, features = ["default_no_std"] }
```

`default_no_std` enables certain required features, such as `libm` and `critical-section`, and as many optional crates as possible (currently just `bevy_state`). For atomically-challenged platforms such as the Raspberry Pi Pico, `portable-atomic` will be used automatically.

For library authors, we recommend depending on `bevy` with `default-features = false` to allow `std` and `no_std` users to both depend on your crate. Here are some recommended features a library crate may want to expose:

```toml
[features]
# Most users will be on a platform which has `std` and can use the more-powerful `async_executor`.
default = ["std", "async_executor"]

# Features for typical platforms.
std = ["bevy/std"]
async_executor = ["bevy/async_executor"]

# Features for `no_std` platforms.
libm = ["bevy/libm"]
critical-section = ["bevy/critical-section"]

[dependencies]
# We disable default features to ensure we don't accidentally enable `std` on `no_std` targets, for example. 
bevy = { version = "0.16", default-features = false }
```

While this is verbose, it gives the maximum control to end-users to decide how they wish to use Bevy on their platform.

We encourage library authors to experiment with `no_std` support. For libraries relying exclusively on `bevy` and no other dependencies, it may be as simple as adding `#![no_std]` to your `lib.rs` and exposing features as above! Bevy can also provide many `std` types, such as `HashMap`, `Mutex`, and `Instant` on all platforms. See `bevy::platform_support` for details on what's available out of the box!

## Migration Guide

- If you were previously relying on `bevy` with default features disabled, you may need to enable the `std` and `async_executor` features.
- `bevy_reflect` has had its `bevy` feature removed. If you were relying on this feature, simply enable `smallvec` and `smol_str` instead.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The journey began with a fundamental limitation - Bevy's tight coupling to Rust's standard library prevented its use in embedded systems and other `no_std` environments. This PR tells the story of how Bevy learned to thrive beyond the comforts of `std`, much like a fledgling bird leaving its nest.

The core challenge lay in Bevy's architectural assumptions. Like many game engines, it relied heavily on OS features for threading, file I/O, and async operations. The first breakthrough came through careful feature gating:

```toml
# crates/bevy_internal/Cargo.toml
[features]
default = ["bevy_default"]
bevy_default = ["std", "async_executor"]
default_no_std = ["libm", "critical-section", "bevy_state"]
```

This feature restructuring created a bridge between worlds. By making `std` an optional feature rather than a hard requirement, the team could preserve existing functionality while carving a path for `no_std` adoption.

The real test came with atomic operations. Platforms like the Raspberry Pi Pico (thumbv6m architecture) lack native atomic instructions. Here, the `portable-atomic` crate became the secret weapon, providing software-emulated atomics. The CI pipeline gained a new sentinel:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check no_std support
  run: cargo check --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --features default_no_std
```

This "canary target" approach ensured continued compatibility without committing to full embedded platform support. It's a clever balance between validation and maintenance burden.

The architecture evolved through strategic decomposition. Heavy components like `bevy_tasks` gained alternative implementations:

```rust
// crates/bevy_tasks/src/single_threaded_task_pool.rs
#[cfg(not(feature = "multi-threaded"))]
impl TaskPool {
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self, InvalidTaskPool> {
        Ok(Self {
            // Simplified single-threaded implementation
        })
    }
}
```

Library authors received clear guidance through example configurations, enabling them to create bridges between `std` and `no_std` ecosystems. The migration path emphasized backward compatibility, ensuring existing users could transition smoothly.

## Key Files Changed

1. **CI Configuration (.github/workflows/ci.yml)**
```yaml
# Added:
- name: Check no_std support
  run: cargo check --target thumbv6m-none-eabi --features default_no_std
```
Rationale: Created a safety net for atomic emulation validation

2. **Feature Gates (crates/bevy_internal/Cargo.toml)**
```toml
# Before:
[features]
default = ["bevy_reflect", "bevy_math"]

# After:
[features]
default = ["bevy_default"]
bevy_default = ["std", "async_executor"]
default_no_std = ["libm", "critical-section", "bevy_state"]
```
Impact: Established the foundation for dual-mode operation

3. **Task Pool Adaptation (crates/bevy_tasks/src/single_threaded_task_pool.rs)**
```rust
// Simplified implementation
#[cfg(not(feature = "multi-threaded"))]
impl TaskPool {
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self, InvalidTaskPool> {
        Ok(Self { /* Single-threaded core */ })
    }
}
```
Purpose: Enabled fallback execution strategies for resource-constrained environments
