## Description Translation
# Objective

- `#[require(Disabled)]` doesn't work as you'd expect

## Solution

- `#[derive(Default)]`

## The Story of This Pull Request

The core issue stemmed from Bevy's `#[require(component)]` attribute not functioning as intended with the `Disabled` component. In Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS), this attribute enables systems to automatically add missing components to entities. However, this automation requires the component to implement `Default` to create new instances when needed.

The `Disabled` component, which controls entity visibility and interaction, originally lacked this Default implementation:

```rust
#[derive(Component, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct Disabled;
```

This prevented systems using `#[require(Disabled)]` from automatically adding the component to entities that lacked it. The solution required a one-line modification adding the Default derive:

```rust
#[derive(Component, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Default)]
pub struct Disabled;
```

This change aligns `Disabled` with Bevy's expectations for components used with `#[require]`. The Default implementation for a marker struct like `Disabled` simply creates an empty instance, enabling the ECS to automatically manage the component's presence as needed.

The implementation choice was straightforward but impactful. By adhering to Bevy's established patterns for component requirements, this change maintains consistency while fixing unexpected behavior. No alternatives were necessary since this aligns with standard Bevy component design practices.

## Visual Representation

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/entity_disabling.rs** (+1/-1)
```rust
// Before:
#[derive(Component, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct Disabled;

// After:
#[derive(Component, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Default)]
pub struct Disabled;
```

This single-line change enables automatic component addition through Bevy's `#[require]` system attribute. The added Default trait implementation allows the ECS to create Disabled components when required by systems but missing from entities.
