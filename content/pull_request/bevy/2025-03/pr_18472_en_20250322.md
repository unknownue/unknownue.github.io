## Description Translation
# Objective

Every time I run `cargo clippy -p bevy_ecs` it pops up and it's distracting.

## Solution

Removed unnecessary returns. The blocks themselves are necessary or the `#[cfg(...)]` doesn't apply properly

## Testing

`cargo clippy -p bevy_ecs` + ci build tests

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a persistent Clippy lint warning in Bevy's single-threaded task pool implementation. During routine development workflows, running `cargo clippy -p bevy_ecs` would generate unnecessary return warnings in `single_threaded_task_pool.rs`, creating noise that distracted from more critical static analysis findings.

The root cause was explicit `return` statements in builder pattern methods that didn't need them. In Rust, the last expression in a function block is automatically returned without requiring the `return` keyword. The original code contained several instances like:

```rust
pub fn num_threads(self, _num_threads: usize) -> Self {
    return self;
}
```

These explicit returns triggered Clippy's `clippy::needless_return` lint. The developer recognized that while the method bodies needed to remain as blocks (to maintain proper `#[cfg(...)]` attribute application), the `return` keywords themselves were redundant.

The solution involved systematically removing explicit returns from seven builder methods in `TaskPoolBuilder`, making the code more idiomatic. For example:

```rust
// Before
pub fn num_threads(self, _num_threads: usize) -> Self {
    return self;
}

// After
pub fn num_threads(self, _num_threads: usize) -> Self {
    self
}
```

This change required understanding two key Rust concepts:
1. Implicit returns from block expressions
2. The interaction between attribute macros and block structure

The developer preserved the method blocks (`{}`) because removing them would break conditional compilation attributes like `#[cfg(feature = "std")]` that control code inclusion based on build configuration. This demonstrates careful consideration of Rust's macro system requirements while addressing the lint warnings.

Testing involved verifying two outcomes:
1. Successful elimination of Clippy warnings via `cargo clippy -p bevy_ecs`
2. Maintenance of correct conditional compilation behavior through CI builds

The changes had no functional impact on Bevy's task pool implementation since they only affected code style. However, they improved code quality by:
- Reducing cognitive load during code reviews
- Making static analysis output more actionable
- Aligning with Rust community style conventions

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_tasks/src/single_threaded_task_pool.rs` (+5/-5)
1. **Modification**: Removed explicit `return` statements from builder methods
2. **Code Example**:
```rust
// Typical pattern changed in multiple methods
// Before:
pub fn stack_size(self, _stack_size: usize) -> Self {
    return self;
}

// After:
pub fn stack_size(self, _stack_size: usize) -> Self {
    self
}
```
3. **Rationale**: Makes code more idiomatic while preserving necessary block structure for conditional compilation attributes
