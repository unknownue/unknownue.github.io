## Description Translation
# Objective

As pointed out in #18177 this line in the doc comment for `UiTargetCamera`:

```
/// Optional if there is only one camera in the world. Required otherwise.
```

is incorrect. `UiTargetCamera` component is only needed when you want to display UI nodes using a camera other than the default camera.

## Solution

Change it to:
```
/// Root node's without an explicit [`UiTargetCamera`] will be rendered to the default UI camera,
/// which is either a single camera with the [`IsDefaultUiCamera`] marker component or the highest
/// order camera targeting the primary window.
```

## The Story of This Pull Request

The journey begins with a sharp-eyed community member discovering a documentation gremlin lurking in Bevy's UI system. In the shadows of `UiTargetCamera`'s doc comments, an innocent-sounding but misleading statement had taken root: "Optional if there is only one camera in the world. Required otherwise." This seemingly reasonable guidance hid a subtle misunderstanding of how Bevy's camera systems actually work.

The problem came to light through issue #18177, where developers realized the documentation was leading users astray. The original statement suggested camera count alone determined the need for `UiTargetCamera`, when in reality the component serves a more specific purpose: controlling which camera renders particular UI elements, regardless of the total number of cameras in the scene.

The developer embarked on a quest to clarify this crucial distinction. Through careful analysis of Bevy's rendering pipeline, they recognized that:

1. The default UI camera isn't determined by camera count, but through specific markers and window targeting
2. `UiTargetCamera` isn't about camera quantity, but about explicit control
3. The existing documentation could cause developers to add unnecessary components or miss required ones

The solution emerged as a surgical documentation update. The new explanation weaves together two key concepts:
```rust
/// Root node's without an explicit [`UiTargetCamera`] will be rendered to the default UI camera,
/// which is either a single camera with the [`IsDefaultUiCamera`] marker component or the highest
/// order camera targeting the primary window.
```

This revision does more than fix a typo - it maps the actual behavior of Bevy's camera selection system. By explaining the fallback mechanism (first `IsDefaultUiCamera`, then highest-order primary window camera), it helps developers understand when and why to use `UiTargetCamera`.

The change reflects a deeper truth about API documentation: precise wording matters. Where the original comment focused on presence/absence, the new version explains behavior flow. This helps developers reason about:
- How to override default rendering targets
- What constitutes the "default" camera
- The role of camera ordering in window targeting

## Visual Representation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[UI Node] --> B{Has UiTargetCamera?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Render to specified camera]
    B -->|No| D[Default UI Camera]
    D --> E[Camera with IsDefaultUiCamera]
    D --> F[Highest-order primary window camera]
```

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ui/src/ui_node.rs** (+3/-1)
```rust
// Before:
/// Optional if there is only one camera in the world. Required otherwise.

// After:
/// Root node's without an explicit [`UiTargetCamera`] will be rendered to the default UI camera,
/// which is either a single camera with the [`IsDefaultUiCamera`] marker component or the highest
/// order camera targeting the primary window.
```

This single-line change in documentation carries outsized importance. By clarifying the actual camera selection logic, it:
- Prevents misuse of the `UiTargetCamera` component
- Documents implicit system behavior that was previously unspecified
- Bridges the gap between API surface and underlying implementation
