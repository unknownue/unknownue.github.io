# #18421 Add more methods to `RelationshipSourceCollection`

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Add more methods to `RelationshipSourceCollection`
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18421
- **Author**: Brezak
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Created**: 2025-03-19T16:06:59Z
- **Merged**: Not merged
- **Merged By**: N/A

## Description Translation
# Objective

While working on #18058 I realized I could use `RelationshipTargetCollection::new`, so I added it.

## Solution

- Add `RelationshipTargetCollection::new`
- Add `RelationshipTargetCollection::reserve`. Could generally be useful when doing micro-optimizations.
- Add `RelationshipTargetCollection::shrink_to_fit`. Rust collections generally don't shrink when removing elements. Might be a good idea to call this once in a while.

## Testing

`cargo clippy`

---

## Showcase

`RelationshipSourceCollection` now implements `new`, `reserve` and `shrink_to_fit` to give greater control over how much memory it consumes.

## Migration Guide

Any type implementing `RelationshipSourceCollection` now needs to also implement `new`, `reserve` and `shrink_to_fit`. `reserve` and `shrink_to_fit` can be made no-ops if they conceptually mean nothing to a collection.

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
While working on optimization improvements for Bevy's ECS relationships (#18058), the author encountered a missing constructor pattern in relationship collections. The existing `RelationshipSourceCollection` trait lacked standard collection methods that would enable better memory management and initialization control. Specifically:

1. No explicit constructor (`new`) made initialization inconsistent
2. Missing capacity management methods (`reserve`, `shrink_to_fit`) limited performance optimization opportunities
3. Existing implementations might retain unused allocated memory after element removal

These limitations became apparent when trying to optimize relationship handling, where precise control over memory allocation is crucial for performance in entity-heavy scenarios.

### The Solution Approach
The PR addresses these gaps by extending the `RelationshipSourceCollection` trait with three essential methods commonly found in Rust collections:

1. **Constructor Pattern**: Added `new()` for standardized initialization
2. **Capacity Management**: Introduced `reserve()` for pre-allocation optimization
3. **Memory Optimization**: Implemented `shrink_to_fit()` to reduce memory footprint

The implementation follows Rust's standard library conventions for collections while maintaining flexibility for different storage strategies (e.g., `Vec<Entity>` vs `EntityHashSet`).

### The Implementation
The core changes occur in the trait definition:

```rust
pub trait RelationshipSourceCollection {
    // New methods added to the trait
    fn new() -> Self;
    fn reserve(&mut self, additional: usize);
    fn shrink_to_fit(&mut self);
    
    // Existing methods remain unchanged
    fn add(&mut self, entity: Entity) -> bool;
    fn remove(&mut self, entity: Entity) -> bool;
    // ... other original methods
}
```

Key implementation details:

1. **Default Flexibility**: `reserve` and `shrink_to_fit` can be no-ops for collections where these operations don't apply (e.g., hash-based storage)
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing implementors must add these methods but can choose appropriate implementations
3. **Performance Hooks**: Enables optimizations like:
   ```rust
   fn reserve(&mut self, additional: usize) {
       self.vec.reserve(additional); // For Vec-based storage
   }
   ```

### Technical Insights
The changes leverage Rust's trait system to provide:
- **Consistent Initialization**: `new()` aligns with Rust's convention for type constructors
- **Memory Control**: `reserve()` allows systems to pre-allocate based on expected workload
- **Optimization Surface**: `shrink_to_fit()` helps mitigate one of Rust's common collection behaviors where capacity isn't automatically reduced

The PR maintains backward compatibility through careful trait design:
- New required methods are explicit but allow no-op implementations
- Existing collection types (like `EntityHashSet`) can implement these with minimal overhead

### The Impact
These changes enable:
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Systems can now optimize allocations for known entity counts
2. **Performance Predictability**: Pre-allocation reduces reallocation costs during insertion
3. **API Consistency**: Matches developer expectations from standard Rust collections

For example, a system building relationships between 1000 entities can now:
```rust
let mut collection = RelationshipSourceCollection::with_capacity(1000);
collection.reserve(1000); // Ensure space for all elements
// ... bulk insert operations
collection.shrink_to_fit(); // Trim excess capacity
```

    D --> G[Memory Optimization]
```

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/relationship/relationship_source_collection.rs` (+60/-1)
**Purpose**: Enhance the core trait for relationship source collections

Key modifications:
```rust
// Added trait methods
pub trait RelationshipSourceCollection {
    // New constructor
    fn new() -> Self;
    
    // Capacity management
    fn reserve(&mut self, additional: usize);
    fn shrink_to_fit(&mut self);
    
    // Existing methods remain unchanged
    // ...
}
```

Implementation notes:
- `new()` provides a standard initialization path
- `reserve()` enables capacity pre-allocation
- `shrink_to_fit()` allows memory optimization post-removal
