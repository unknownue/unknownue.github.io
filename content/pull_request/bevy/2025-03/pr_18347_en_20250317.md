Small bugfix.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a caching invalidation issue in Bevy's rendering system where changes to camera texture usage flags weren't properly triggering cache updates. The core problem stemmed from the `prepare_view_targets` system not considering `CameraMainTextureUsages` in its caching key, potentially leading to stale data being reused when only texture usage flags changed.

The critical realization was that `CameraMainTextureUsages` - which controls whether a camera's main texture is used for read/write operations - directly impacts how render targets should be prepared. Prior to this fix, the caching mechanism keyed only on:
- Camera component
- Entity ID
- Fixed depth flag

This meant that if a camera's texture usage changed while other parameters remained constant, the system would incorrectly reuse previously cached values. The solution modifies the cache key to include `CameraMainTextureUsages` as part of the system parameters:

```rust
// Before
type ViewTargetKey = (
    Entity,
    &'static Camera,
    Has<FixedDepth>,
);

// After
type ViewTargetKey = (
    Entity,
    &'static Camera,
    Has<FixedDepth>,
    &'static CameraMainTextureUsages, // Added to cache key
);
```

This change ensures cache entries are properly invalidated when texture usage configurations change. The implementation required only a one-line modification to the system parameter tuple, demonstrating how careful selection of cache key components is crucial in ECS-based systems like Bevy.

The impact is significant for rendering correctness - particularly in scenarios where cameras toggle between read-only and write-enabled states between frames. Without this fix, such changes could lead to incorrect texture bindings or missed render target updates.

```

## Key Files Changed

**File**: `crates/bevy_render/src/view/mod.rs` (+1/-1)

The critical change adds `CameraMainTextureUsages` to the system parameters used for caching:

```rust
// Before system param definition:
#[derive(SystemParam)]
pub struct ViewTargetKey<'w> {
    entity: Entity,
    camera: &'w Camera,
    fixed_depth: Has<FixedDepth>,
}

// After modification:
#[derive(SystemParam)]
pub struct ViewTargetKey<'w> {
    entity: Entity,
    camera: &'w Camera,
    fixed_depth: Has<FixedDepth>,
    camera_main_texture_usages: &'w CameraMainTextureUsages, // Added
}
```

This single-line addition ensures the caching system accounts for texture usage changes when determining whether to reuse previous frame data.
