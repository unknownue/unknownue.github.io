# #18431 Fix incorrect command given by the benchmarking README

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Fix incorrect command given by the benchmarking README
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18431
- **Author**: kirawulff
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Created**: 2025-03-20T00:41:29Z
- **Merged**: Not merged
- **Merged By**: N/A

## Description Translation
Note: Fixing this caused me to open #18430. On the whole, this fix and that bug don't really depend on each other, so I'm opening this PR anyways

# Objective

- Fixes #18387 

## Solution

- Very small update to benchmarking documentation
- Checked through to ensure consistency with other documentation. The only other mention of benchmarking commands I could find is a comment in the `Cargo.toml` associated with the benchmarking; the correct command is already listed there.

## Testing

- Manual testing on command line using updated commands
- Caused me to see #18430


## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a documentation error in Bevy's benchmarking guide that prevented developers from correctly running specific benchmarks. The root issue (#18387) stemmed from an incorrect cargo command syntax in the benches/README.md file, where the `--bench` flag wasn't properly formatted.

The problem manifested in this command example:
```sh
cargo bench -p benches --bench ecs
```
Which should technically be:
```sh
cargo bench -p benches --bench=ecs
```
The missing equals sign between `--bench` and the benchmark name caused cargo to misinterpret the arguments. This formatting issue is critical because cargo's command-line parser requires either `--bench=NAME` or `--bench NAME` syntax, with the former being more unambiguous.

During the fix, the author:
1. Identified all instances of the incorrect command format
2. Cross-referenced with other documentation (including Cargo.toml comments)
3. Verified consistency with existing correct examples
4. Manually tested the corrected commands

This process uncovered an unrelated issue (#18430) during testing, demonstrating how thorough validation of documentation changes can surface deeper problems.

The implementation required only two character changes in the README but carries disproportionate importance. Clear benchmarking instructions are crucial for:
- Accurate performance measurements
- Contributor onboarding
- CI/CD pipeline consistency

The fix maintains alignment with Rust's cargo command conventions while eliminating a potential friction point for developers working with Bevy's performance tooling.

## Key Files Changed

### File: `benches/README.md`
**Change**: Fixed cargo command syntax for benchmark filtering

Before:
```sh
cargo bench -p benches --bench ecs
```

After:
```sh
cargo bench -p benches --bench=ecs
```

**Impact**: Ensures developers can successfully execute specific benchmarks using the documented commands, preventing frustration and wasted troubleshooting time.
