-- If this PR is a breaking change (relative to the last release of Bevy), describe how a user might need to migrate their code to support these changes
-- Simply adding new functionality is not a breaking change.
-- Fixing behavior that was definitely a bug, rather than a questionable design choice is not a breaking change.
