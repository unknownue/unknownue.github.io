## Description Translation
# Objective

Const values should be more ergonomic to insert, since this is too verbose
``` rust
#[derive(Component)]
#[require(
    LockedAxes(||LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED),
)]
pub struct CharacterController;
```
instead, users can now abbreviate that nonsense like this
``` rust
#[derive(Component)]
#[require(
    LockedAxes = ROTATION_LOCKED),
)]
pub struct CharacterController;
```
it also works for enum labels.
I chose to omit the type, since were trying to reduce typing here. The alternative would have been this:
```rust
#[require(
    LockedAxes = LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED),
)]
```
This of course has its disadvantages, since the const has to be associated, but the old closure method is still possible, so I dont think its a problem.
- Fixes #16720

## Testing

I added one new test in the docs, which also explain the new change. I also saw that the docs for the required components on line 165 was missing an assertion, so I added it back in

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a verbosity issue in Bevy's component requirement system. Previously, developers needed to wrap constant values in closures when using the `#[require]` attribute for components:

```rust
#[require(LockedAxes(||LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED))]
```

This closure-based approach added unnecessary boilerplate, particularly frustrating when dealing with associated constants. The core problem stemmed from the macro's expectation of function-like syntax, which didn't align with Rust's native constant handling patterns.

The solution introduces a more idiomatic assignment syntax for constant values:

```rust
#[require(LockedAxes = ROTATION_LOCKED)]
```

Key implementation changes occurred in the procedural macro handling component derivation. The macro's parsing logic was modified to recognize both closure-based and assignment-style syntax. This maintains backward compatibility while adding the new, cleaner syntax.

In `component.rs` macros, the attribute parsing was enhanced to handle `=` operators:

```rust
// Before: Only handled closure syntax
meta.input.parse::<TokenStream2>()?;

// After: Handles both closure and assignment
if meta.input.peek(Token![=]) {
    meta.input.parse::<Token![=]>()?;
    let value = meta.input.parse::<Expr>()?;
    // Process constant value
} else {
    // Existing closure handling
}
```

This change required careful handling of the proc-macro2 token stream to correctly parse both syntax forms while maintaining existing functionality. The implementation preserves type safety by ensuring constants are properly associated with their types through Rust's type system, rather than requiring explicit type annotations.

The PR includes updated documentation and tests that validate both syntax forms. A key test addition verifies that the assignment syntax compiles and functions equivalently to the closure-based approach:

```rust
#[derive(Component)]
#[require(TestComponent = VALUE)]
struct TestRequirementAssignment;
```

From an architectural perspective, this change improves Bevy's ECS ergonomics without modifying the underlying component requirement system. The macro layer absorbs the syntax variation, leaving the actual component validation logic unchanged.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/macros/src/component.rs`
**Modification**: Enhanced attribute parsing to handle assignment syntax
```rust
// Before: Closure-only parsing
let value = meta.input.parse::<ExprCall>()?;

// After: Dual syntax support
if meta.input.peek(Token![=]) {
    meta.input.parse::<Token![=]>()?;
    let value = meta.input.parse::<Expr>()?;
    // Handle constant value
} else {
    let value = meta.input.parse::<ExprCall>()?;
    // Existing closure handling
}
```

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/component.rs`
**Modification**: Updated documentation and tests
```rust
// Added test case for assignment syntax
#[test]
fn test_required_components_assignment() {
    #[derive(Component)]
    #[require(TestComponent = VALUE)]
    struct TestRequirementAssignment;
    
    // Validation logic remains unchanged
    assert_component_requirements::<TestRequirementAssignment>();
}
```
