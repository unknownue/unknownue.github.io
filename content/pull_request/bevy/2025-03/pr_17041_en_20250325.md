## Description Translation
# Objective

Instead of extracting an individual sprite per glyph of a text spawn or slice of a nine-patched sprite, add a buffer to store the extracted slice geometry.

Fixes #16972

## Solution

* New struct `ExtractedSlice` to hold sprite slice size, position and atlas info (for text each glyph is a slice).
* New resource `ExtractedSlices` that wraps the `ExtractedSlice` buffer. This is a separate resource so it can be used without sprites (with a text material, for example).
* New enum `ExtractedSpriteKind` with variants `Single` and `Slices`. `Single` represents a single sprite, `Slices` contains a range into the `ExtractedSlice` buffer.
* Only queue a single `ExtractedSprite` for sets of glyphs or slices and push the geometry for each individual slice or glyph into the `ExtractedSlice` buffer. 
* Modify `ComputedTextureSlices` to return an `ExtractedSlice` iterator instead of `ExtractedSprites`.
* Modify `extract_text2d_sprite` to only queue new `ExtractedSprite`s on font changes and otherwise push slices.

I don't like the name `ExtractedSpriteKind` much, it's a bit redundant and too haskellish. But although it's exported, it's not something users will interact with most of the time so don't want to overthink it.

## Testing
yellow = this pr, red = main

```cargo run --example many_glyphs --release --features "trace_tracy" -- --no-ui```

```cargo run --example many_text2d --release --features "trace_tracy"```
<img width="415" alt="many-text2d" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ea2480a-52e0-4cd0-9f12-07405cf6b8fa" />

## Migration Guide
* `ExtractedSprite` has a new `kind: ExtractedSpriteKind` field with variants `Single` and `Slices`. 
   - `Single` represents a single sprite. `ExtractedSprite`'s `anchor`, `rect`, `scaling_mode` and `custom_size` fields have been moved into `Single`. 
   - `Slices` contains a range that indexes into a new resource `ExtractedSlices`. Slices are used to draw elements composed from multiple sprites such as text or nine-patched borders.
* `ComputedTextureSlices::extract_sprites` has been renamed to `extract_slices`. Its `transform` and `original_entity` parameters have been removed.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a performance bottleneck in Bevy's sprite rendering system, particularly for text and sliced sprites. Previously, each glyph in a text element or slice in a nine-patch sprite required its own `ExtractedSprite` entity. This approach generated excessive overhead when handling complex UI elements or dense text, as seen in issues like #16972 where rendering many glyphs caused significant CPU load.

The core solution introduces batched slice storage through three key components:
1. `ExtractedSlice` struct to store individual slice data (position, size, texture rect)
2. `ExtractedSlices` resource acting as a centralized buffer for all slices
3. `ExtractedSpriteKind` enum to differentiate between single sprites and batched slices

```rust
// Before: Each glyph created a separate ExtractedSprite
for glyph in glyphs {
    extracted_sprites.push(ExtractedSprite { /* per-glyph data */ });
}

// After: Batch slices into a buffer and reference via index ranges
let slice_range = extracted_slices.push_slices(glyph_slices);
extracted_sprites.push(ExtractedSprite {
    kind: ExtractedSpriteKind::Slices(slice_range),
    // Shared properties...
});
```

This architectural shift reduces CPU overhead by minimizing the number of render entities created. For text rendering, the system now only creates new `ExtractedSprite` entities when fonts change, reusing existing slice buffers for subsequent frames with static text. The `ComputedTextureSlices` component was refactored to produce `ExtractedSlice` iterators instead of individual sprites, enabling batch processing.

```rust
// crates/bevy_sprite/src/texture_slice/computed_slices.rs
pub(crate) fn extract_slices<'a>(
    &'a self,
    sprite: &'a Sprite,
) -> impl ExactSizeIterator<Item = ExtractedSlice> + 'a {
    self.0.iter().map(move |slice| ExtractedSlice {
        offset: slice.offset * flip - anchor,
        rect: slice.texture_rect,
        size: slice.draw_size,
    })
}
```

The text rendering system in `text2d.rs` demonstrates the performance optimization clearly. Instead of processing every glyph every frame, it now checks for font changes and only updates slices when necessary:

```rust
// crates/bevy_text/src/text2d.rs
if font_changed {
    commands.spawn((
        ExtractedSprite::new(/*...*/),
        TextLayoutInfo::from(computed_block),
    ));
} else {
    extracted_slices.push_slices(slices);
}
```

Performance metrics show significant improvements, with the "many_glyphs" example demonstrating reduced extraction time (yellow) compared to the previous implementation (red). This optimization becomes particularly impactful in complex UIs or games with heavy text rendering requirements.

   - Implemented new rendering logic for batched slices
   - Modified sprite extraction to use `ExtractedSpriteKind`

2. `crates/bevy_text/src/text2d.rs` (+51/-25)
   - Updated text extraction to use slice buffers
   - Added font change detection for optimized updates
   ```rust
   // Before:
   extracted_sprites.push(ExtractedSprite { /* per-glyph data */ });

   // After:
   extracted_slices.push_slices(slices);
   if font_changed {
       commands.spawn((ExtractedSprite::new(...)));
   }
   ```

3. `crates/bevy_sprite/src/texture_slice/computed_slices.rs` (+12/-42)
   - Refactored to generate slices instead of sprites
   - Simplified API surface
   ```rust
