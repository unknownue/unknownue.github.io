## Description Translation
# Objective

The sort key for the transparent UI phase is a (float32, u32) pair consisting of the stack index and the render entity's index. 
I guess the render entity index was intended to break ties but it's not needed as the sort is stable.  It also assumes the indices of the render entities are generated sequentially, which isn't guaranteed.

Fixes the issues with the text wrap example seen in #18266

## Solution

Change the sort key to just use the stack index alone.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a subtle rendering ordering issue in Bevy's UI system. The core problem stemmed from how transparent UI elements were sorted during rendering. The existing implementation used a composite sort key comprising two values: a stack index (float32) and an entity index (u32). While this appeared functional initially, it contained two hidden flaws.

First, the entity index portion assumed that entities were created in sequential order - an assumption not guaranteed by Bevy's ECS implementation. In reality, entity indices can be reused or assigned non-sequentially, potentially leading to unexpected rendering order artifacts. Second, the stable sort algorithm used in the render phase already preserves insertion order for equal elements, making the entity index redundant for tie-breaking.

The solution required modifying multiple locations in the UI rendering code where sort keys were constructed. By removing the entity index from the sort key tuple, the implementation became both simpler and more robust. This change eliminated the artificial dependency on entity creation order while maintaining correct rendering behavior through the stable sort's inherent preservation of insertion order.

The impact was immediately visible in the text wrap example (#18266), where overlapping UI elements could render in incorrect orders due to entity index inconsistencies. This fix ensures UI elements render predictably based solely on their logical stacking order, regardless of entity creation patterns.

1. **crates/bevy_ui/src/render/render_pass.rs**
```rust
// Before:
.sort_key(FloatOrd(transforms.stack_index) , entity.index())

// After:
.sort_key(FloatOrd(transforms.stack_index))
```
Removed entity index from sort key construction in main UI render pass

2. **crates/bevy_ui/src/render/box_shadow.rs**
```rust
// Before:
.sort_key(FloatOrd(stack_index), entity.index())

// After:
.sort_key(FloatOrd(stack_index))
```
Updated box shadow rendering to use simplified sort key

3. **crates/bevy_ui/src/render/ui_material_pipeline.rs**
```rust
// Before:
.sort_key(FloatOrd(stack_index), entity.index())

// After:
.sort_key(FloatOrd(stack_index))
```
Modified material pipeline to match new sort key format
