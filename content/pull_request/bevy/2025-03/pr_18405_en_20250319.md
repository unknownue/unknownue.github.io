## Solution

- enable `std` when building bevy_dylib

## The Story of This Pull Request

The problem surfaced when building bevy_dylib for ARM64 architectures resulted in linker errors related to missing critical section symbols. These symbols (`__critical_section_1_0_acquire` and `__critical_section_1_0_release`) are required by the `critical_section` crate used in Bevy's task system. The errors indicated the build system wasn't linking the required implementations for thread synchronization primitives.

The root cause stemmed from `bevy_dylib` being built without Rust's standard library (no_std). While Bevy supports no_std environments, certain components like the task system require OS-level threading support when building as a dynamic library. The `critical_section` crate's implementation differs based on std availability - without std, it expects external implementations of these symbols that weren't being provided in this configuration.

The solution modifies the build configuration to explicitly enable the standard library for bevy_dylib. This ensures:

1. The `critical_section` crate uses its std-based implementation
2. Required threading primitives are properly linked
3. Platform-specific synchronization functions are available

The key code change occurs in `crates/bevy_dylib/Cargo.toml` where the Bevy dependency specification was updated to include the "std" feature:

```toml
# Before
bevy = { path = "../bevy", default-features = false }

# After
bevy = { path = "../bevy", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }
```

This change propagates the std feature through Bevy's dependency graph, ensuring all downstream crates (including `bevy_tasks` and its `critical_section` dependency) use their std-enabled implementations. The fix addresses the immediate linking issue while maintaining compatibility with Bevy's overall feature flag architecture.

The impact is immediate and specific - ARM64 builds of bevy_dylib now complete successfully without requiring changes to Bevy's core architecture. This demonstrates the importance of consistent feature flag propagation in Rust workspaces, particularly when mixing no_std and std components.

## Key Files Changed

- `crates/bevy_dylib/Cargo.toml` (+5/-1)

**Change Description**:
Modified Bevy dependency features to include "std" when building the dynamic library target. This ensures proper linkage of threading primitives required by the task system.
