## Description Translation
# Objective

The latest version of nixpkgs doesn't include the file, breaking the old link.

## Solution

Change the nixos packaging example link to a permalink with the latest known version of the 'jumpy' program.

## Testing

- Did you test these changes? If so, how?
  - No testing needed. Just a link change.
- Are there any parts that need more testing?
  - No

## The Story of This Pull Request

This documentation update addresses a specific but critical issue for NixOS users following Bevy's Linux dependency instructions. The problem stemmed from nixpkgs' rolling release model, where package definitions frequently change. A link to the 'jumpy' program's Nix packaging example had become invalid after nixpkgs updated, leaving developers with a broken reference when setting up their environment.

The solution demonstrates effective documentation maintenance practices. By replacing a dynamic link with a GitHub permalink pointing to a specific commit (d10b06a997), the author ensures long-term reference stability. This permalink approach locks the example to a known-working version while still preserving context through the full file path reference.

The implementation required minimal but precise changes:
```markdown
- [Example NixOS packaging](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/games/jumpy/default.nix)
+ [Example NixOS packaging](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/d10b06a997/pkgs/games/jumpy/default.nix)
```
This diff shows the strategic replacement of `master` with a specific commit hash in the URL. The change prevents future breakage from nixpkgs updates while maintaining access to a relevant configuration example.

For Bevy maintainers, this PR highlights the importance of using permanent links (permalinks) when referencing external resources that may change. The technical insight here is recognizing that documentation links require the same stability considerations as code dependencies - transient references create maintenance overhead and user confusion.

## Key Files Changed

**File**: `docs/linux_dependencies.md` (+1/-1)

**Change**: Updated a single documentation link from dynamic to permanent reference

**Before**:
```markdown
[Example NixOS packaging](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/games/jumpy/default.nix)
```

**After**:
```markdown
[Example NixOS packaging](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/d10b06a997/pkgs/games/jumpy/default.nix)
```

**Impact**: Ensures the packaging example remains accessible regardless of future nixpkgs changes
