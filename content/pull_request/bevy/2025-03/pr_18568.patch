+Keep it short and sweet:
+
+- Use bullet points and make sure it's searchable.
+- Avoid headings. If you must, use only level-two headings.
+- Use backticks for types (e.g. `Vec<T>`) in either the title or the body.
+- Diff codeblocks can also be useful for succinctly communicating changes.

+```diff
+fn my_system(world: &mut World) {
++ world.new_method();
+- world.old_method();
