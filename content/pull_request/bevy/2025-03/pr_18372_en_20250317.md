## Description Translation
# Objective

Use the const `all` fn to create the UiRect consts instead of setting the fields individually.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a maintenance improvement in Bevy's UI layout system by refactoring how `UiRect` constants are initialized. `UiRect` is a fundamental struct for UI layout that defines margins/padding through four fields: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`. The original implementation manually set each field when creating constants, while the new approach leverages the existing `UiRect::all` constructor.

**The Problem**: Several `UiRect` constants were defined through repetitive field initialization:
```rust
pub const ZERO: Self = UiRect {
    left: Val::Px(0.0),
    right: Val::Px(0.0),
    top: Val::Px(0.0),
    bottom: Val::Px(0.0),
};
```
This pattern duplicated the same value assignment across multiple fields, creating maintenance overhead and potential for inconsistency if the struct definition changed.

**The Solution**: The PR replaces manual field initialization with calls to `UiRect::all`, a const function designed to set all fields to the same value:
```rust
pub const ZERO: Self = UiRect::all(Val::Px(0.0));
```
This approach achieves three key benefits:
1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: 29 lines removed vs 4 added
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Future struct changes automatically propagate to constants
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with existing API patterns in the codebase

**Implementation Details**: The changes focused on `geometry.rs` where `UiRect` is defined. Constants like `ZERO`, `DEFAULT`, and `AUTO` were refactored to use the constructor. The `UiRect::all` method was already const-safe, making it suitable for constant initialization.

**Technical Insight**: This change demonstrates effective use of Rust's const fn capabilities for type-safe constant initialization. By relying on the existing constructor, the PR maintains the same memory layout and runtime characteristics while improving source code quality.

**Impact**: The refactor makes the UI layout code more resilient to future changes. If new fields are added to `UiRect`, constants using `::all` will automatically include them without requiring manual updates. This pattern also sets a precedent for cleaner constant initialization elsewhere in the codebase.

## Visual Representation

    A[UiRect Constants] --> B[UiRect::all]

    B --> E[Top]
    B --> F[Bottom]
```

## Key Files Changed

**File**: `crates/bevy_ui/src/geometry.rs` (+4/-29)

Before:
```rust
pub const ZERO: Self = UiRect {
    left: Val::Px(0.0),
    right: Val::Px(0.0),
    top: Val::Px(0.0),
    bottom: Val::Px(0.0),
};

pub const DEFAULT: Self = UiRect {
    left: Val::DEFAULT,
    right: Val::DEFAULT,
    top: Val::DEFAULT,
    bottom: Val::DEFAULT,
};
```

After:
```rust
pub const ZERO: Self = UiRect::all(Val::Px(0.0));
pub const DEFAULT: Self = UiRect::all(Val::DEFAULT);
```

The changes simplify constant definitions while maintaining identical runtime behavior. All modified constants now delegate field initialization to the `all` constructor, reducing visual clutter and potential human error.
