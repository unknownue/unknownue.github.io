## Description Translation
# Objective

#18555 added improved require syntax, but inline structs didn't support `..Default::default()` syntax (for technical reasons we can't parse the struct directly, so there is manual logic that missed this case).

## Solution

When a `{}` or `()` section is encountered for a required component, rather than trying to parse the fields directly, just pass _all_ of the tokens through. This ensures no tokens are dropped, protects us against any future syntax changes, and optimizes our parsing logic (as we're dropping the field parsing logic entirely).


## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a limitation in Bevy's ECS component requirement syntax that emerged after previous improvements to the system. While #18555 enhanced require syntax capabilities, it introduced an edge case where struct initialization patterns using `..Default::default()` weren't properly handled due to limitations in the macro parsing logic.

The root issue stemmed from the macro's attempt to parse struct fields directly, which couldn't account for the spread operator (`..`) in struct initialization. This led to syntax tokens being dropped during parsing, breaking valid Rust patterns that users might reasonably expect to work.

The solution pivoted from field-level parsing to a more robust token-passing approach. When encountering braces `{}` or parentheses `()`, the macro now forwards all contained tokens without inspection. This achieves three key benefits:

1. **Syntax Preservation**: Ensures no tokens are lost during macro expansion
2. **Future Compatibility**: Accommodates potential Rust syntax changes
3. **Simplified Maintenance**: Reduces parser complexity by eliminating field-specific logic

In the macro implementation, this translated to replacing targeted field parsing with direct token capture. For example:

```rust
// Before: Attempted field-by-field parsing
let fields = input.parse::<Fields>()?;

// After: Direct token capture
let content;
braced!(content in input);
let tokens = content.parse::<TokenStream2>()?;
```

This change affected the core parsing logic in `bevy_ecs/macros/src/component.rs`, where component requirements are processed. By letting Rust's own compiler handle the final syntax validation, the implementation becomes both more reliable and less maintenance-heavy.

The PR also included test updates to verify the new behavior with various syntax patterns, ensuring cases like `MyComponent { ..Default::default() }` now work as expected. These tests validate both struct and tuple struct initialization patterns.

From an architectural perspective, this change aligns with Rust's macro philosophy of deferring detailed syntax validation to the compiler where possible. The Bevy ECS system benefits from reduced maintenance burden while gaining more flexible component initialization syntax.

## Key Files Changed

### File: `crates/bevy_ecs/macros/src/component.rs`
**Changes**: Modified component attribute parsing to handle brace/paren blocks as token streams
```rust
// Before: Field-specific parsing
let fields = input.parse::<Fields>()?;
let member = parse_member(field.ident.as_ref())?;

// After: Full token capture
let content;
braced!(content in input);
let tokens = content.parse::<TokenStream2>()?;
quote! { #tokens }
```

### File: `crates/bevy_ecs/src/component.rs`
**Changes**: Updated tests to verify new syntax support
```rust
// Added test case
#[test]
fn required_component_with_default() {
    let mut world = World::new();
    world.init_component::<MyComponent>();
    
    // This syntax would previously fail
    world.entity_mut(entities[0])
        .insert(MyComponent { ..Default::default() });
}
```
