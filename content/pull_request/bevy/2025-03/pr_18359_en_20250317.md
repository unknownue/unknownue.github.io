## Description Translation
# Objective

Add a `UiRect::AUTO` const which is a `UiRect` with all its edge values set to `Val::Auto`.

IIRC `UiRect`'s default for its fields a few versions ago was `Val::Auto` because positions were represented using a `UiRect` and they required `Val::Auto` as a default. Then when position was split up and the `UiRect` default was changed, we forgot add a `UiRect::AUTO` const.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a missing convenience constant in Bevy's UI layout system. The core issue stemmed from an evolution in how UI positioning is handled within the engine. Previously, `UiRect` (a struct representing rectangular UI dimensions) used `Val::Auto` as its default value for all edges. This made sense when UI positions were managed through `UiRect`, as automatic layout calculations were the primary use case.

When the positioning system was refactored to separate concerns, `UiRect`'s default values changed. However, the team overlooked preserving an easy way to create a `UiRect` instance with all edges set to `Val::Auto` - a common requirement for developers implementing automatic layout behaviors.

The solution introduces a simple but impactful addition: a `pub const AUTO` in `UiRect`'s implementation. This constant provides a standardized way to create auto-layout rectangles without manual field initialization. The implementation is straightforward but strategically placed in the type's core definition for maximum discoverability:

```rust
impl UiRect {
    pub const AUTO: Self = Self {
        left: Val::Auto,
        right: Val::Auto,
        top: Val::Auto,
        bottom: Val::Auto,
    };
}
```

This change doesn't alter existing default values or runtime behavior. It purely adds a developer convenience that:
1. Reduces boilerplate when creating auto-layout UI elements
2. Centralizes the auto-layout configuration pattern
3. Maintains consistency with other Bevy types that offer similar constants

The technical rationale focuses on API ergonomics rather than performance considerations. By using a `const` instead of a default instance, developers gain:
- Compile-time initialization guarantees
- Clear intent when initializing UI components
- Protection against accidental field overwrites in partial initializations

For existing codebases, this change is non-breaking and additive. Developers can progressively adopt `UiRect::AUTO` where appropriate, replacing manual constructions like:
```rust
UiRect {
    left: Val::Auto,
    right: Val::Auto,
    top: Val::Auto,
    bottom: Val::Auto,
}
```
with the more concise and intention-revealing `UiRect::AUTO`.

## Visual Representation

    A --> D[Val::Auto]
    A --> E[Val::Auto]
    style B fill:#cfc,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#cfc,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#cfc,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#cfc,stroke:#333
```

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ui/src/geometry.rs** (+7 lines)
```rust
// Before: No AUTO constant available
impl UiRect {
    // Existing methods...
}

// After:
impl UiRect {
    pub const AUTO: Self = Self {
        left: Val::Auto,
        right: Val::Auto,
        top: Val::Auto,
        bottom: Val::Auto,
    };
}
```
This addition provides a canonical way to create auto-configured UI rectangles. The constant follows Rust's standard constant pattern for geometric types in Bevy, maintaining API consistency across the engine.
