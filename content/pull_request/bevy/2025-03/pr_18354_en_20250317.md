## The Story of This Pull Request

This dependency update addresses the routine maintenance of CI tooling in the Bevy engine project. The primary motivation was to incorporate improvements from the typos checker tool that helps maintain code quality by catching spelling mistakes in the codebase.

The typos crate-ci tool received a minor version update (1.30.1 → 1.30.2) introducing new debugging features. The key addition was the `--highlight-words` and `--highlight-identifiers` flags, which help developers visualize how the tool processes words and identifiers during spell checking. This improves maintainers' ability to debug false positives or configure exceptions in the typos configuration.

As an automated dependabot PR, the implementation required minimal changes - specifically updating the version reference in the GitHub Actions workflow file. The compatibility score of 100 indicated low risk of breaking changes, allowing for straightforward integration. The update process followed standard dependency management practices, where non-breaking minor versions can be safely adopted without extensive testing beyond existing CI checks.

The single-line change in the CI configuration ensures that all subsequent Bevy PRs will benefit from the enhanced debugging capabilities when the typos check runs. This maintains the project's code quality standards while improving maintainer ergonomics for handling typos configuration.

## Key Files Changed

**.github/workflows/ci.yml**  
Updated the typos action version to leverage new debugging features:

```yaml
# Before:
- name: Typos
  uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.30.1

# After:
- name: Typos
  uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.30.2
```

This change ensures the CI pipeline uses the latest typos checker version with enhanced debugging capabilities.
