## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a straightforward code quality issue in Bevy's rendering system. The core problem was an unused constant (`INSTANCE_INDEX_SHADER_HANDLE`) that had persisted in the codebase despite no longer serving any functional purpose. Such dead code can lead to unnecessary maintenance overhead and potential confusion for developers working in the codebase.

The investigation began with a simple text search across the project using the constant's literal name. This revealed no references beyond its initial declaration, confirming it wasn't being used in any active code paths. The constant appeared to be a leftover from previous implementations or experimental features that never materialized into production code.

The solution required minimal but precise action: complete removal of the unused constant. This approach follows standard code hygiene practices, where eliminating dead code helps:
1. Reduce cognitive load for developers
2. Prevent accidental future use of deprecated patterns
3. Maintain compile-time efficiency by reducing unnecessary symbols

While the change appears simple, it demonstrates good maintenance practices. The lack of required testing stems from the nature of the change - since the constant wasn't referenced anywhere, its removal couldn't break existing functionality. However, this case highlights the importance of regular code audits in large projects like Bevy, where accumulated technical debt can manifest as orphaned code fragments.

## Key Files Changed

### File: `crates/bevy_render/src/lib.rs`
**Change Description**: Removal of an unused constant declaration

**Before** (hypothetical reconstruction based on PR context):
```rust
// Somewhere in the codebase:
pub const INSTANCE_INDEX_SHADER_HANDLE: Handle<Shader> = /* initialization */;
```

**After**:
```rust
// The constant declaration was completely removed
```

This change eliminates dead code from the rendering module. The removed constant was likely part of an older rendering system implementation that has since been refactored or replaced. By removing it, the codebase becomes slightly smaller and easier to navigate.
