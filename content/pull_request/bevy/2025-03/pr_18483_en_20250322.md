# #18483 Remove `bevy_input_focus` from `bevy_a11y`

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Remove `bevy_input_focus` from `bevy_a11y`
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18483
- **Author**: bushrat011899
- **Status**: MERGED

## Description Translation
# Objective

- Compiling `bevy_a11y` without default features fails because you need to select a floating point backed. But you actually don't need it, this requirement is from an unused linkage to `bevy_input_focus`

## Solution

- Remove link

## Testing

- CI

## The Story of This Pull Request

The problem stemmed from an unnecessary dependency chain in Bevy's accessibility module. When users attempted to compile `bevy_a11y` without default features, they encountered unexpected requirements for floating-point support. This requirement traced back to `bevy_input_focus` being included in the dependency graph despite not being actively used.

The core issue was identified in the crate's feature flags and dependency declarations. The `bevy_a11y` crate indirectly depended on `bevy_input_focus` through feature activation, which brought in floating-point dependencies through `bevy_ui`. This violated the principle of minimal dependencies, particularly problematic for targets where floating-point support might be constrained.

The solution involved surgical removal of the unused dependency. By auditing the dependency tree and feature flags, the developer:

1. Removed `bevy_input_focus` from `bevy_a11y`'s feature dependencies
2. Cleaned up related feature declarations in `bevy_internal`
3. Verified through CI that the accessibility features remained functional without the dependency

Key technical considerations included:
- Understanding Rust's feature flag propagation
- Analyzing transitive dependencies through Cargo.toml files
- Maintaining compatibility with Bevy's modular architecture

The changes demonstrate effective dependency management by:
- Eliminating unnecessary build requirements
- Reducing binary size for constrained targets
- Simplifying the feature graph for downstream users

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_a11y/Cargo.toml`
**Changes**: Removed `bevy_input_focus` dependency and related feature flags  
**Impact**: Eliminates floating-point requirement when using non-default features

Before (simplified):
```toml
[dependencies]
bevy_input_focus = { path = "../bevy_input_focus", version = "0.16.0-dev" }
```

After:
```toml
# Dependency removed entirely
```

### `crates/bevy_internal/Cargo.toml`
**Changes**: Removed residual reference in feature declarations  
**Impact**: Ensures clean feature activation without hidden dependencies

Before:
```toml
[features]
default = ["bevy_input_focus", ...]
```

After:
```toml
[features]
default = [...]  # bevy_input_focus reference removed
```
