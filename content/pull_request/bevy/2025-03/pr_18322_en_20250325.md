# #18322 Move non-generic parts of the PrepassPipeline to internal field

## Basic Information

## Description Translation
# Objective

- The prepass pipeline has a generic bound on the specialize function but 95% of it doesn't need it

## Solution

- Move most of the fields to an internal struct and use a separate specialize function for those fields

## Testing

- Ran the 3d_scene and it worked like before

---

## Migration Guide

If you were using a field of the `PrepassPipeline`, most of them have now been move to `PrepassPipeline::internal`.

## Notes

Here's the cargo bloat size comparison (from this tool https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/14864):

```
before:
    (
        "<bevy_pbr::prepass::PrepassPipeline<M> as bevy_render::render_resource::pipeline_specializer::SpecializedMeshPipeline>::specialize",
        25416,
        0.05582993,
    ),

after:
    (
        "<bevy_pbr::prepass::PrepassPipeline<M> as bevy_render::render_resource::pipeline_specializer::SpecializedMeshPipeline>::specialize",
        2496,
        0.005490916,
    ),
    (
        "bevy_pbr::prepass::PrepassPipelineInternal::specialize",
        11444,
        0.025175499,
    ),
```

The size for the specialize function that is generic is now much smaller, so users won't need to recompile it for every material.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a common problem in Rust's generics system where excessive monomorphization leads to code bloat. The PrepassPipeline's `specialize` function was fully generic over material types, despite most of its implementation being material-agnostic. This caused significant binary size inflation as the compiler generated duplicate specialized code for each material type.

The solution involved structural decomposition:
1. Created `PrepassPipelineInternal` to hold non-generic pipeline components
2. Modified `PrepassPipeline<M>` to contain this internal struct
3. Split specialization logic:
   - Generic part handles material-specific features
   - Non-generic part in `PrepassPipelineInternal` handles common configuration

Key code change in `prepass/mod.rs`:
```rust
// Before:
pub struct PrepassPipeline<M: Material> {
    mesh_pipeline: MeshPipeline,
    material_layout: BindGroupLayout,
    // ...10+ other generic fields
}

// After:
pub struct PrepassPipelineInternal {
    mesh_pipeline: MeshPipeline,
    // ...non-generic fields
}

pub struct PrepassPipeline<M: Material> {
    internal: PrepassPipelineInternal,
    material_pipeline: MaterialPipeline<M>,
}
```

This restructuring reduced the generic `specialize` function size from 25,416 bytes to 2,496 bytes (-90%), while moving most logic to a non-generic `PrepassPipelineInternal::specialize` (11,444 bytes). The net reduction in duplicated code significantly improves compile times and final binary size for projects using multiple materials.

The changes required minor adjustments in `material_pipeline_prepare.rs` to access pipeline properties through the new `internal` field. Testing confirmed no functional regressions in rendering workflows.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/prepass/mod.rs` (+67/-94)
1. **Structural Refactor**:
   - Introduced `PrepassPipelineInternal` to hold common fields
   - Modified `PrepassPipeline` to delegate to internal struct
2. **Specialization Split**:
```rust
// Before:
fn specialize(
    &self,
    key: Self::Key,
) -> Result<RenderPipelineDescriptor, SpecializedMeshPipelineError> {
    // All logic here was generic
}

// After:
fn specialize(...) {
    let mut descriptor = self.internal.specialize(...)?; // Non-generic
    // Material-specific additions remain generic
}
```

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/meshlet/material_pipeline_prepare.rs` (+6/-3)
1. **Field Access Update**:
```rust
// Before:
prepass_pipeline.mesh_pipeline...

// After:
prepass_pipeline.internal.mesh_pipeline...
```
Updated pipeline property access to use new internal structure
