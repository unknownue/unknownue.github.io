## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR represents a routine dependency maintenance update in the Bevy game engine. Dependabot, GitHub's automated dependency update bot, detected that the `notify-debouncer-full` crate had released version 0.7.0 and created this PR to update Bevy's dependency specification accordingly.

The `notify-debouncer-full` crate is used by Bevy's asset system for file watching functionality, specifically for hot-reloading assets during development. When a developer modifies an asset file (like a texture or sound file) while the game is running, the file watcher detects the change and triggers a reload of that asset. This feature is conditional and only available on non-WASM32 targets, as indicated by the `[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]` section in the Cargo.toml file.

The update from version 0.6.0 to 0.7.0 includes two significant changes that affect Bevy's asset hot-reloading capabilities. First, the new version adds WebAssembly (wasm) build support, which means the notify library can now potentially work in wasm environments, though Bevy currently only uses it on non-wasm targets. Second, and more importantly for Bevy's use case, version 0.7.0 fixes a bug where events within the timeout period weren't properly deduplicated, causing the `event_handler` callback to be called multiple times for events that should have been merged. This fix addresses potential inefficiencies in Bevy's asset hot-reloading where a single file change might trigger multiple reload events instead of being properly batched.

The change itself is minimal - a single line modification in the Cargo.toml file that updates the version constraint. However, the implications are important for Bevy's development experience. The event deduplication fix means that when developers make rapid changes to asset files (such as saving multiple times in quick succession), the asset system will respond more predictably and efficiently, reducing unnecessary processing overhead and potential race conditions in the hot-reloading pipeline.

It's worth noting that the release notes mention a change in MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) policy, which could potentially affect users who are constrained to specific Rust versions. However, since this is a minor version update (0.6.0 to 0.7.0) within a pre-1.0 crate, and the dependency is marked as optional (`optional = true`), the impact on Bevy users is minimal. The update went through the standard review and testing process, was merged after about two weeks, and became part of Bevy's dependency graph.

## Key Files Changed

List the most significant files changed in this PR:
- `crates/bevy_asset/Cargo.toml` (+1/-1)

For each important file, include:
1. A brief description of what changed and why
2. Code snippets showing the key modifications (both before and after if applicable). DO NOT translate any comments/code in Code snippets.
3. How these changes relate to the overall purpose of the PR

**File:** `crates/bevy_asset/Cargo.toml`

1. **What changed and why:** The version constraint for the `notify-debouncer-full` dependency was updated from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0 to take advantage of bug fixes and new features in the latest release, specifically improved event deduplication and WASM support.

2. **Code snippets:**

```toml
# Before:
notify-debouncer-full = { version = "0.6.0", default-features = false, optional = true }

# After:
notify-debouncer-full = { version = "0.7.0", default-features = false, optional = true }
```

3. **Relation to overall purpose:** This single-line change is the entire purpose of the PR - updating the dependency version to incorporate the improvements and fixes from the notify-debouncer-full 0.7.0 release.
