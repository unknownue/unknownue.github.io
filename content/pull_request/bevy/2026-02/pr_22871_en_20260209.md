## Description Translation

# Objective

The `SLASHED_ZERO` `FontFeatureTag` constant is set to "ordn" but the correct tag is "zero".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typographic_features

## Solution

Set it to "zero".

## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request addresses a straightforward bug in Bevy's text rendering system. The issue centers around a constant definition for OpenType font features that was incorrectly specified.

The problem originated in the `FontFeatureTag` implementation within Bevy's text module. OpenType fonts support various typographic features that are controlled through four-character tags. These tags are standardized across the industry, and Bevy provides a set of constants to make working with these features more convenient and less error-prone. One of these constants, `SLASHED_ZERO`, was incorrectly defined with the value `"ordn"` (which actually corresponds to the "ordinals" feature), when it should have been `"zero"` (the correct tag for the slashed zero feature).

The bug was likely introduced during initial implementation or a subsequent refactoring. When a developer would use the `SLASHED_ZERO` constant expecting to enable slashed zeros in text rendering, the system would instead attempt to enable the ordinals feature. This would either have no visible effect (if the font didn't support ordinals) or produce unexpected typographic changes.

The fix is minimal and precise - changing a single character in a constant definition from "ordn" to "zero". This correction aligns Bevy's implementation with the OpenType specification and ensures that developers using this constant get the expected behavior. The change affects only the compile-time definition and doesn't require any modifications to runtime logic or data structures.

The impact of this fix is that text rendered with the `SLASHED_ZERO` feature enabled will now correctly display zeros with slashes through them, which is particularly useful in contexts where it's important to distinguish between the digit zero and the letter O (such as in technical documentation, code displays, or certain typographic designs).

## Visual Representation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[FontFeatureTag Constants] --> B[SLASHED_ZERO constant]
    B --> C{Value check}
    C -->|Incorrect| D["ordn" (Ordinals feature)]
    C -->|Correct| E["zero" (Slashed zero feature)]
    F[OpenType Specification] --> C
```

## Key Files Changed

- `crates/bevy_text/src/text.rs` (+1/-1)

This file contains the `FontFeatureTag` type which provides constants for OpenType font features. The change fixes a single constant definition:

**Before:**
```rust
pub const SLASHED_ZERO: FontFeatureTag = FontFeatureTag::new(b"ordn");
```

**After:**
```rust
pub const SLASHED_ZERO: FontFeatureTag = FontFeatureTag::new(b"zero");
```

The change replaces the incorrect tag "ordn" (which corresponds to the ordinals feature) with the correct tag "zero" (which corresponds to the slashed zero feature). This ensures that when developers use the `SLASHED_ZERO` constant, it correctly activates the intended typographic feature.
