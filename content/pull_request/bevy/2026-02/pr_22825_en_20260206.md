## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR is a straightforward dependency update for the Bevy Engine's GitHub Actions workflow. Dependabot, GitHub's automated dependency management tool, detected that the `github/codeql-action` used in the repository's security static analysis workflow could be updated from version 4.32.0 to 4.32.2 and automatically generated this pull request.

The problem being addressed is keeping security tooling up-to-date. In software development, especially for security scanning tools, staying current with the latest versions is critical because updates often include new security checks, bug fixes, and improvements to analysis accuracy. Outdated security tools might miss newly discovered vulnerabilities or produce false positives that have been addressed in later versions. However, blindly updating dependencies without review can also introduce breaking changes or compatibility issues, which is why these updates are presented as PRs for human review rather than automatically merged.

The solution approach is simple: update the version reference in two places in the workflow file. The engineering decision here follows standard practice for GitHub Actions - using pinned versions with specific commit SHAs rather than floating tags to ensure reproducibility and avoid unexpected changes. When updating, the maintainer changes both the SHA reference and adds a comment with the new version number for clarity.

Looking at the implementation, there are only two changes in a single file. Both changes follow the same pattern: updating the SHA reference for the `github/codeql-action` from the previous version's commit SHA to the new version's commit SHA. This ensures that the workflow uses the exact version 4.32.2 of the CodeQL action. The version update brings several improvements based on the release notes, most notably updating the underlying CodeQL bundle to version 2.24.1, which likely includes updated query packs and analysis capabilities.

From a technical perspective, this update demonstrates several important practices. First, the use of Dependabot for dependency management in GitHub Actions workflows ensures that security tools remain current without requiring manual monitoring. Second, the PR shows the value of automated dependency updates in maintaining security posture. Third, the approach of using commit SHAs rather than version tags provides deterministic builds and prevents "version drift" where different runs might use different minor versions if tags aren't pinned.

The impact of these changes is primarily in the security analysis domain. The Bevy project benefits from the latest CodeQL capabilities, including potentially improved analysis accuracy, new security checks, and bug fixes from the two patch releases (4.32.1 and 4.32.2). Specifically, version 4.32.1 fixed a bug where the CodeQL Action would fail when repository properties couldn't be retrieved, which could prevent workflow failures in edge cases. The update also includes a warning system for private package registry configuration issues, which helps developers identify misconfigurations earlier.

This PR serves as a good example of routine maintenance in a modern software project. It shows how automated tooling like Dependabot can handle dependency updates efficiently, allowing developers to focus on more complex tasks while still maintaining control over when and how dependencies are updated. The quick merge (approximately 1 hour after creation) suggests that the update was considered safe and beneficial, likely due to the patch-level nature of the changes and the high compatibility score shown in the PR description.

## Key Files Changed

### `.github/workflows/security-static-analysis.yml` (+2/-2)

This is the only file changed in this PR. It contains the GitHub Actions workflow for running CodeQL static analysis on the Bevy codebase. The workflow is part of the project's security scanning strategy, running automated code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

**What changed**: Updated the version of the `github/codeql-action` from 4.32.0 to 4.32.2 in two places where the action is invoked.

**Code changes**:

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/security-static-analysis.yml
# Before (line 45):
-        uses: github/codeql-action/init@b20883b0cd1f46c72ae0ba6d1090936928f9fa30 # v4.32.0

# After:
+        uses: github/codeql-action/init@45cbd0c69e560cd9e7cd7f8c32362050c9b7ded2 # v4.32.2
```

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/security-static-analysis.yml
# Before (line 73):
-        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@b20883b0cd1f46c72ae0ba6d1090936928f9fa30 # v4.32.0

# After:
+        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@45cbd0c69e560cd9e7cd7f8c32362050c9b7ded2 # v4.32.2
```

**Why these changes were made**: The updates ensure that Bevy's security scanning uses the latest version of the CodeQL action, which includes bug fixes and updates to the underlying CodeQL analysis engine. The changes affect both the initialization and analysis phases of the CodeQL workflow, ensuring consistency throughout the security scanning process.

**Relationship to overall PR purpose**: These are the only changes needed to update the CodeQL action version. Both changes are required because the workflow uses the action in two separate steps: one to initialize the CodeQL tools and another to perform the actual analysis.
