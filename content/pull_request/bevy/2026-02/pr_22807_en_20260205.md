## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a simple but important issue in the Bevy codebase: redundant documentation warnings. The developer noticed that multiple crates were explicitly configuring lint warnings for missing documentation (`#![warn(missing_docs)]` or `#![deny(missing_docs)]`) while the project already had a blanket deny policy for missing documentation at the workspace level. This redundancy created unnecessary noise in the codebase and potential confusion for contributors.

The problem stems from having both global and local configuration for the same lint rule. When a project sets documentation requirements at the workspace level in the root `Cargo.toml` or via other mechanisms, individual crates don't need to repeat these configurations. Having both can lead to:

1. Maintenance overhead - developers might think they need to update both places
2. Potential conflicts if configurations differ
3. Visual clutter in source files

The solution was straightforward: remove the redundant lint configurations from three specific files where they were no longer needed. The changes are minimal but improve codebase hygiene by eliminating duplication and ensuring consistency.

From a technical perspective, this change reflects good engineering practices around DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and centralized configuration management. By removing these local overrides, the codebase becomes easier to understand and maintain, as developers only need to look in one place (the workspace configuration) to understand the documentation requirements.

The implementation required no complex refactoring or architectural changes - simply deleting three lines of configuration that were redundant. This kind of cleanup is important for long-term codebase health, as it reduces cognitive load for developers and prevents potential configuration drift over time.

The impact of this change is primarily on developer experience and codebase maintainability rather than runtime behavior. The same documentation requirements remain in effect, but now they're enforced consistently from a single location. This reduces the risk of someone accidentally removing a local `#![deny(missing_docs)]` and thinking they've disabled documentation requirements when the workspace-level configuration is still active.

This PR also demonstrates the importance of periodically reviewing and cleaning up configuration duplication, even for seemingly minor issues like lint settings. Small improvements like this contribute to overall codebase quality.

## Key Files Changed

### 1. `crates/bevy_camera_controller/src/lib.rs`
**Changes**: Removed `#![warn(missing_docs)]` attribute
**Why**: This warning was redundant with the workspace-level documentation policy
**Code**:
```rust
// Before:
#![warn(missing_docs)]

// After: (line removed)
// The warning is now controlled at the workspace level
```

### 2. `crates/bevy_picking/src/lib.rs`
**Changes**: Removed `#![deny(missing_docs)]` attribute
**Why**: This deny directive was redundant with the workspace-level documentation policy
**Code**:
```rust
// Before:
#![deny(missing_docs)]

// After: (line removed)
// The deny is now controlled at the workspace level
```

### 3. `crates/bevy_ui/src/picking_backend.rs`
**Changes**: Removed `#![deny(missing_docs)]` attribute
**Why**: This deny directive was redundant with the workspace-level documentation policy
**Code**:
```rust
// Before:
#![deny(missing_docs)]

// After: (line removed)
// The deny is now controlled at the workspace level
```
