## Description Translation

# Objective

Hello, this pr fixes #22892

## Solution

I fixed the 'missing import' bug, by hard coding the import in the code generated by the proc macro.

## Testing

The code example given in the issue now compiles fine.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a compile-time error in Bevy's state system that was affecting the `SubStates` derive macro. The issue was subtle but important - when developers used the `#[derive(SubStates)]` macro on their types, the generated code failed to compile due to a missing trait import.

The problem originated in how the procedural macro generated trait implementations. Specifically, when implementing the `State` trait for a substate type, the generated code needed to reference the `SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH` constant from the `StateSet` trait. However, the original code generation assumed this constant was accessible without the proper trait qualification.

Looking at the before code:
```rust
const DEPENDENCY_DEPTH : usize = <Self as #trait_path>::SourceStates::SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH + 1;
```

The issue here is that `SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH` is an associated constant of the `StateSet` trait, not an inherent constant of the type `SourceStates`. The compiler needs to know which trait defines this constant, but the generated code was attempting to access it directly on the type.

The fix is straightforward but requires understanding Rust's trait system. The solution involves adding the necessary trait qualification to the generated code:

```rust
const DEPENDENCY_DEPTH : usize = <<Self as #trait_path>::SourceStates as #state_set_trait_path>::SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH + 1;
```

Here's what changed technically:
- The original code tried to access `SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH` directly on `SourceStates`
- The fixed code explicitly casts `SourceStates` to `#state_set_trait_path` (which expands to `StateSet`) before accessing the constant
- This ensures the compiler can find the `SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH` constant in the correct trait's namespace

This is a common pattern in Rust procedural macros where generated code needs to be explicit about trait bounds and qualifications. The macro generates code that users don't see directly, so any missing imports or trait qualifications cause cryptic compile errors that are hard for users to debug.

The fix demonstrates an important principle in Rust macro development: generated code needs to be fully qualified to avoid dependency on the user's imports. This is why the solution "hard codes" the import - by using the fully qualified path `<<Self as #trait_path>::SourceStates as #state_set_trait_path>`, the generated code doesn't rely on any imports in the user's code.

The impact of this bug was that any project using `SubStates` with certain configurations would fail to compile. The fix restores functionality without changing the public API - it's purely an internal correction to the code generation logic.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_state/macros/src/states.rs` (+1/-1)

This file contains the procedural macro that generates code for the `SubStates` derive macro. The change fixes a trait qualification issue in the generated code.

**Before:**
```rust
const DEPENDENCY_DEPTH : usize = <Self as #trait_path>::SourceStates::SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH + 1;
```

**After:**
```rust
const DEPENDENCY_DEPTH : usize = <<Self as #trait_path>::SourceStates as #state_set_trait_path>::SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH + 1;
```

The key change is the addition of `as #state_set_trait_path` to properly qualify the `SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH` constant. This ensures the generated code can find the constant in the `StateSet` trait's namespace.

## Further Reading

1. **Rust Traits and Associated Constants**: Understanding how associated constants work in Rust traits is essential for working with procedural macros that generate trait implementations.
   
2. **Procedural Macros in Rust**: The Rust Book's chapter on procedural macros provides a good foundation for understanding how code generation works in Rust.

3. **Bevy State System**: The Bevy engine's state system documentation explains how states and substates work together to manage game state transitions.

4. **Fully Qualified Syntax in Rust**: When there are naming conflicts or when you need to be explicit about which trait's method or constant you're using, fully qualified syntax (`<Type as Trait>::item`) is the solution.

5. **Issue #22892**: The original issue report provides context about the specific compilation error that users encountered, which helps understand the real-world impact of the bug.
