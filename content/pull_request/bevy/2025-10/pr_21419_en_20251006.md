## Description Translation
Fixes a clippy error introduced by #21338. Issue was inside a `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]` block so it wasn't caught by CI.

```rust
error: this boolean expression can be simplified
   --> crates\bevy_winit\src\state.rs:481:16
    |
481 |             if !self.app_exit.is_some()
    |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: try: `self.app_exit.is_none()`
```

Tested with Rust 1.90.0, Win10, `cargo run -p ci -- lints`, `cargo run --example window_settings`.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request addresses a straightforward but important code quality issue in the Bevy game engine's windowing system. The problem emerged from a subtle oversight in conditional compilation that allowed a Clippy lint violation to slip through CI testing undetected.

The core issue was a boolean expression in Windows-specific code that violated Rust's idiomatic conventions. In the `WinitAppRunnerState` implementation, specifically within the `ApplicationHandler` trait, there was a condition checking `!self.app_exit.is_some()`. While functionally correct, this pattern is considered non-idiomatic in Rust because it unnecessarily negates a positive check when a direct negative check exists. Clippy, Rust's linter, correctly identified this as a code quality issue that should be simplified to the more direct `self.app_exit.is_none()`.

What made this issue particularly interesting was its discovery context. The problematic code was wrapped in a `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]` conditional compilation attribute, meaning it only compiled on Windows systems. Since Bevy's CI pipeline likely runs on multiple platforms but may not execute Clippy checks on all of them, this Windows-specific code path escaped detection during the initial code review and CI validation process for PR #21338.

The solution implemented here is minimal but precise. The developer replaced the verbose boolean negation pattern with the idiomatic alternative suggested by Clippy. This change demonstrates an important principle in software engineering: even platform-specific code should adhere to the same quality standards as platform-agnostic code. The fix maintains identical functionality while improving code readability and adhering to Rust's established conventions.

From an engineering perspective, this PR highlights several valuable lessons. First, it underscores the importance of comprehensive CI coverage across all target platforms. Second, it shows how conditional compilation can create blind spots in code quality checks. Third, it demonstrates that even trivial one-line changes can have significant implications for code maintainability and team development workflows.

The testing approach was thorough despite the change's simplicity. The author verified the fix using Rust 1.90.0 on Windows 10, running both the linter checks (`cargo run -p ci -- lints`) and functional testing with the window settings example. This demonstrates good engineering practice - validating that the fix resolves the lint warning without introducing regressions in actual functionality.

## Key Files Changed

**File: `crates/bevy_winit/src/state.rs`**
- **Change**: Fixed Clippy lint by replacing non-idiomatic boolean expression with idiomatic equivalent
- **Impact**: Resolves code quality issue in Windows-specific code path

```rust
// Before:
if !self.app_exit.is_some()
    && (self.startup_forced_updates > 0
        || matches!(self.update_mode, UpdateMode::Reactive { .. })
        || self.window_event_received

// After:
if self.app_exit.is_none()
    && (self.startup_forced_updates > 0
        || matches!(self.update_mode, UpdateMode::Reactive { .. })
        || self.window_event_received
```

The change replaces `!self.app_exit.is_some()` with `self.app_exit.is_none()`, which is the idiomatic Rust way to check if an Option is None. This maintains exactly the same logical behavior while following Rust's established conventions.
