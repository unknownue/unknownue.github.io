## Description Translation
Improve grammar, clarity, and documentation style in lib.rs

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses documentation quality in Bevy's main library file (`lib.rs`) through a series of targeted improvements to grammar, punctuation, and clarity. The changes follow a systematic approach to enhancing the developer experience by making the documentation more professional and easier to understand.

The core issue being addressed is that while the existing documentation was functional, it contained several instances of awkward phrasing, missing punctuation, and inconsistent terminology that could confuse new users or make the project appear less polished. These types of documentation improvements are important because `lib.rs` serves as the primary entry point for developers exploring the Bevy codebase and is often the first documentation they encounter.

The implementation strategy focuses on three main areas: punctuation consistency, grammatical improvements, and terminology standardization. For punctuation, the changes add missing commas in compound sentences and standardize list formatting. In terms of grammar, the PR fixes awkward phrasing and improves sentence flow. For terminology, it ensures consistent use of "Bevy" capitalization and clarifies technical descriptions.

One notable change is the update from "Hello World" to "Hello, World!" in the example code comment. While this seems minor, it follows the conventional punctuation for this common programming example and demonstrates attention to detail. Similarly, the change from "full" engine experience to "full engine" experience improves readability by making the phrase more natural.

The technical insight here is that documentation quality directly impacts developer onboarding and project perception. Well-maintained documentation reduces cognitive load for new contributors and signals that the project values quality throughout the codebase. The changes in this PR demonstrate how small, focused improvements can collectively enhance the developer experience without requiring complex architectural changes.

The impact of these changes is primarily on developer experience and codebase maintainability. The improved documentation makes it easier for new contributors to understand Bevy's structure and purpose, while the consistent terminology and grammar reduce ambiguity in technical descriptions. These improvements also set a higher standard for documentation quality throughout the codebase.

## Key Files Changed

**File: `src/lib.rs`** (+9/-9)

This file contains Bevy's main library documentation and module exports. The changes focus entirely on improving documentation quality through grammar corrections, punctuation fixes, and terminology standardization.

Key modifications include:

```rust
// Before:
//! Bevy is an open-source modular game engine built in Rust, with a focus on developer productivity
//! and performance.

// After:
//! Bevy is an open-source, modular game engine built in Rust, with a focus on developer productivity
//! and performance.
```

```rust
// Before:
//! Here is a simple "Hello World" Bevy app:

// After:
//! Here is a simple "Hello, World!" Bevy app:
```

```rust
// Before:
//! The `bevy` crate is just a container crate that makes it easier to consume Bevy subcrates.
//! The defaults provide a "full" engine experience, but you can easily enable / disable features

// After:
//! The `bevy` crate is a container crate that makes it easier to consume Bevy subcrates.
//! The defaults provide a "full engine" experience, but you can easily enable or disable features
```

```rust
// Before:
//! Each module in the root of this crate, except for the prelude, can be found on crates.io
//! with `bevy_` appended to the front, e.g. `app` -> [`bevy_app`](https://docs.rs/bevy_app/*/bevy_app/).

// After:
//! Each module in the root of this crate, except for the prelude, can be found on crates.io
//! with `bevy_` appended to the front, e.g., `app` -> [`bevy_app`](https://docs.rs/bevy_app/*/bevy_app/).
```

```rust
// Before:
#[expect(
    unused_imports,
    clippy::single_component_path_imports,
    reason = "This causes bevy to be compiled as a dylib when using dynamic linking, and as such cannot be removed or changed without affecting dynamic linking."
)]

// After:
#[expect(
    unused_imports,
    clippy::single_component_path_imports,
    reason = "This causes Bevy to be compiled as a dylib when using dynamic linking and therefore cannot be removed or changed without affecting dynamic linking."
)]
```

These changes improve the documentation by:
1. Adding proper punctuation in compound sentences
2. Using standard formatting for common programming examples
3. Removing redundant words for conciseness
4. Standardizing terminology and capitalization
5. Improving grammar in technical explanations
