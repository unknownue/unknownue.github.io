<h2>[0.11.0] - 2025-08-27</h2>
<h3>API Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Breaking: <code>SpannedError</code> now stores the full error span in span: Span { start: Position, end: Position }`, to facilitate, e.g., language server highlighting of syntax errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking: Added <code>no_std</code> support via a new <code>std</code> feature (enabled by default). With default features disabled, you must enable the <code>std</code> feature to access <code>de::from_reader</code>, and the <code>std::io</code> operations on <code>Options</code>, such as <code>from_reader</code>, <code>from_reader_seed</code>, <code>to_io_writer</code>, and <code>to_io_writer_pretty</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/567">#567</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking: Fixed (again) <code>ron::value::Number</code> to ensure it is non-exhaustive, to avoid breaking <code>match</code>es when feature unification enables more of its variants than expected (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/568">#568</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a new example <code>file_read_write_vec.rs</code> for reading and writing <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> to/from files. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/573">#573</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.10.1] - 2025-04-08</h2>
<h3>API Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>ron::Options::to_io_writer</code> and <code>ron::Options::to_io_writer_pretty</code> to allow writing into an <code>io::Writer</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/561">#561</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: <code>ron::value::Number</code> is now non-exhaustive, to avoid breaking <code>match</code>es when feature unification enables more of its variants than expected (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/564">#564</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.9.0] - 2025-03-18</h2>
<h3>API Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>ron::value::RawValue</code> helper type which can (de)serialize any valid RON (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/407">#407</a>)</li>
<li>Add <code>escape_strings</code> option to <code>PrettyConfig</code> to allow serialising with or without escaping (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/426">#426</a>)</li>
<li>Add <code>compact_maps</code> and <code>compact_structs</code> options to <code>PrettyConfig</code> to allow serialising maps and structs on a single line (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/448">#448</a>)</li>
<li>Add minimal support for <code>#[serde(flatten)]</code> with roundtripping through RON maps (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/455">#455</a>)</li>
<li>Add minimal roundtripping support for <code>#[serde(tag = &quot;tag&quot;)]</code>, <code>#[serde(tag = &quot;tag&quot;, content = &quot;content&quot;)]</code>, and <code>#[serde(untagged)]</code> enums (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/451">#451</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: Expand the <code>value::Number</code> enum to explicitly encode all possible number types (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/479">#479</a>)</li>
<li>Add <code>number_suffixes</code> option to <code>PrettyConfig</code> to allow serialising numbers with their explicit type suffix, e.g. <code>42i32</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/481">#481</a>)</li>
<li>Allow <code>ron::value::RawValue</code> to capture any whitespace to the left and right of a ron value (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/487">#487</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: Enforce that ron always writes valid UTF-8 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/488">#488</a>)</li>
<li>Add convenient <code>Value::from</code> impls (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/498">#498</a>)</li>
<li>Add new extension <code>explicit_struct_names</code> which requires that struct names are included during deserialization (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/522">#522</a>)</li>
<li>Add new path-based field metadata serialization support via <code>PrettyConfig</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/544">#544</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: Change <code>PrettyConfig</code> so that <code>new_line</code>, <code>indentor</code> and <code>separator</code> are all <code>Cow&lt;'static, str&gt;</code> instead of <code>String</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/546">#546</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Format Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>[Non-API] Breaking: Treat <code>Some</code> like a newtype variant with <code>unwrap_variant_newtypes</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/465">#465</a>)</li>
<li>Allow parsing floating point literals with underscores (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/481">#481</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Format-Breaking:</strong> Switch from base64-encoded to Rusty byte strings, still allow base64 deserialising for now (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/438">#438</a>)</li>
<li>Fix issue <a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/issues/241">#241</a> and allow parsing numbers with explicit type suffixes, e.g. <code>1u8</code> or <code>-1f32</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/481">#481</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for byte literals as strongly typed unsigned 8-bit integers (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/438">#438</a>)</li>
<li>Fix issue <a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/issues/321">#321</a> and allow parsing UTF-8 identifiers (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/488">#488</a>)</li>

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR represents a routine but important dependency maintenance task in the Bevy engine. Dependabot, GitHub's automated dependency management tool, detected that the RON (Rusty Object Notation) serialization library had a new version available and automatically created this update request.

The core challenge in dependency updates is managing compatibility while gaining access to new features and bug fixes. RON 0.11.0 introduces several breaking changes that needed evaluation:

- **no_std support**: The addition of `no_std` support with a new `std` feature (enabled by default) means that crates using RON with default features disabled now need to explicitly enable the `std` feature for I/O operations
- **Error span changes**: `SpannedError` now stores full error spans with start and end positions, which could affect error handling code
- **Number enum changes**: The `ron::value::Number` enum is now non-exhaustive to prevent breaking matches when feature unification enables more variants

The solution approach was straightforward: update the version requirement across all Bevy crates that depend on RON. Since this is a minor version update with breaking changes, the team needed to verify that Bevy's usage patterns weren't affected by the API changes.

The implementation consisted of simple version string updates across five Cargo.toml files. The most notable change was in `bevy_asset`, which uses RON with `default-features = false`. The update preserved this configuration, which means the asset system will continue to use RON without the new `std` feature enabled by default.

Technical insights from this update include:
- The importance of automated dependency management in large Rust projects
- How breaking changes in serialization libraries can affect downstream consumers
- The value of maintaining consistent dependency versions across a workspace

The impact of this update is primarily maintenance-oriented: Bevy gains access to RON's latest features and bug fixes while ensuring long-term compatibility. The quick merge (within 90 minutes) suggests the changes were non-disruptive and the team had confidence in the update.
