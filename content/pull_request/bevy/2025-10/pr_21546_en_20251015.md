Fix typo

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a straightforward but important documentation issue in the Bevy engine's cargo features documentation. The problem was a typo in the template file that generates the cargo features documentation page.

The issue occurred in the documentation for Bevy's feature collections system. Feature collections are mid-level groups of cargo features that compose high-level profiles. When the default profiles don't meet specific use cases - such as using a custom renderer, building a headless app, or targeting no_std environments - developers can use these collections to build custom profile equivalents without manually managing every single feature.

The typo was introduced in a sentence explaining this concept. The word "don't" was incorrectly written as "don'templated", which appears to be a merge artifact or copy-paste error where "templated" from the file extension (.tpl) was accidentally appended to the word.

The fix involved removing the extraneous "emplated" text from two locations:
1. The source template file (`docs-template/features.md.tpl`)
2. The generated documentation file (`docs/cargo_features.md`)

This is a classic example of why documentation quality matters in open source projects. Even minor typos can confuse users and detract from the professional appearance of the project. The fix was trivial from a technical standpoint but important for maintaining clear and professional documentation.

The changes were reviewed and merged quickly, reflecting the straightforward nature of the fix and the project's commitment to documentation quality.

## Key Files Changed

### `docs-template/features.md.tpl` (+1/-1)

This is the template file used to generate the cargo features documentation. The change fixes a typo in the explanatory text about feature collections.

```markdown
# Before:
"If the default profiles don'templated"

# After:
"If the default profiles don't"
```

### `docs/cargo_features.md` (+1/-1)

This is the generated documentation file that contains the same typo, which needed to be fixed to maintain consistency between the template and output.

```markdown
# Before:
"If the default profiles don'templated"

# After:
"If the default profiles don't"
```
