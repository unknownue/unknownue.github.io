## Description Translation
# Objective

- After https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/21885, FPS overlay has some unused warnings when building for wasm without webgpu

## Solution

- Fix them

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a specific compiler warning issue that surfaced after PR #21885 was merged. When building Bevy for WebAssembly (WASM) targets without the WebGPU feature enabled, the compiler started emitting warnings about unused parameters in the FPS overlay system. These warnings weren't breaking functionality, but they cluttered the build output and represented technical debt that could mask real issues.

The root cause was conditional compilation logic in the FPS overlay code. Certain resources, specifically frame time graph materials and shader storage buffers, are only needed when the target architecture supports them. On WASM without WebGPU, these resources aren't used, but their parameters were still declared in function signatures, causing the compiler to warn about them being unused.

The developer approached this by applying more precise conditional compilation attributes. Instead of removing the resources entirely (which would break other configurations), they used `#[cfg_attr]` to conditionally apply the `#[expect(unused)]` attribute. This tells the Rust compiler: "We know these parameters won't be used in this specific configuration, and that's expected behavior - don't warn us about it."

The implementation shows good understanding of Rust's conditional compilation system. The condition `all(target_arch = "wasm32", not(feature = "webgpu"))` precisely targets the problematic configuration. The use of `#[cfg_attr]` with a reason string (`reason = "Unused variables in wasm32 without webgpu feature"`) follows best practices for documentation, making it clear to future developers why this exception exists.

This fix maintains the existing architecture while cleaning up compiler warnings. It doesn't change any functionality - the WASM without WebGPU build path remains the same, just without the warning noise. The solution is minimal and focused, addressing only the specific issue without introducing unnecessary complexity or changes to other parts of the codebase.

From an engineering perspective, this PR demonstrates proper use of Rust's attribute system for platform-specific code. The `#[expect(unused)]` attribute is particularly useful here because it's a lint attribute that can be controlled at the function parameter level, allowing fine-grained suppression of warnings only where needed. This approach is superior to blanket `#[allow(unused)]` attributes because it's more specific and self-documenting.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_dev_tools/src/fps_overlay.rs` (+12/-5)

This file contains the FPS overlay system for development tools. The changes fix compiler warnings that appeared when building for WASM without WebGPU support.

**Key modifications:**

1. **Conditional imports**: Added `#[cfg]` attributes to conditionally import certain modules only when they're actually used:

```rust
// Before:
use bevy_ui_render::prelude::MaterialNode;
use crate::frame_time_graph::{
    FrameTimeGraphConfigUniform, FrameTimeGraphPlugin, FrametimeGraphMaterial,
};

// After:
#[cfg(not(all(target_arch = "wasm32", not(feature = "webgpu"))))]
use bevy_ui_render::prelude::MaterialNode;
#[cfg(not(all(target_arch = "wasm32", not(feature = "webgpu"))))]
use crate::frame_time_graph::FrameTimeGraphConfigUniform;
use crate::frame_time_graph::{FrameTimeGraphPlugin, FrametimeGraphMaterial};
```

2. **Conditional parameter attributes**: Applied `#[cfg_attr]` to suppress unused parameter warnings only in the specific configuration where they're expected to be unused:

```rust
// Before:
fn setup(
    mut commands: Commands,
    overlay_config: Res<FpsOverlayConfig>,
    mut frame_time_graph_materials: ResMut<Assets<FrametimeGraphMaterial>>,
    mut buffers: ResMut<Assets<ShaderStorageBuffer>>,
) {

// After:
fn setup(
    mut commands: Commands,
    overlay_config: Res<FpsOverlayConfig>,
    #[cfg_attr(
        all(target_arch = "wasm32", not(feature = "webgpu")),
        expect(unused, reason = "Unused variables in wasm32 without webgpu feature")
    )]
    (mut frame_time_graph_materials, mut buffers): (
        ResMut<Assets<FrametimeGraphMaterial>>,
        ResMut<Assets<ShaderStorageBuffer>>,
    ),
) {
```

**Relationship to PR purpose:** These changes directly address the compiler warnings described in the PR. The conditional imports prevent unused import warnings, while the `#[cfg_attr]` with `#[expect(unused)]` prevents unused parameter warnings, both specifically for the WASM without WebGPU configuration.
