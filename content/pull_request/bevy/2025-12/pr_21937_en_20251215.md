## Description Translation
# Objective

Add helper functions to `ComputedNode` to compute the scrollbar areas of a UI node.

## Solution

Add `horizontal_scrollbar` and `vertical_scrollbar` functions to `ComputedNode`. If a scrollbar is present, these return an option wrapping a tuple of the node-centered bounding `Rect` for the scrollbar, and the start and end points of the thumb.

## Testing

Includes a couple of tests in the `uinode` module.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a straightforward but practical need in Bevy's UI system: providing programmatic access to scrollbar geometry data. While Bevy's UI system already supports scrollable containers with visual scrollbars, there was no direct API to query where scrollbars are actually positioned on screen or where their draggable thumbs are located. This information is essential for implementing custom scrollbar interaction logic, such as clicking on the scrollbar track to jump to a position, or for visual debugging and testing.

The solution is implemented by adding two new public methods to the `ComputedNode` struct in the `ui_node.rs` file. These methods compute the scrollbar geometry based on the node's existing computed properties. The implementation follows the existing pattern in Bevy's UI system where `ComputedNode` stores layout information after the UI layout pass has been processed.

The core logic resides in two new methods: `horizontal_scrollbar()` and `vertical_scrollbar()`. Each returns an `Option<(Rect, [f32; 2])>`, where the `Option` is `None` if the scrollbar isn't present (determined by checking if `scrollbar_size` has positive dimensions for the respective axis). When present, the tuple contains:
- A `Rect` representing the scrollbar gutter (the entire track area where the scrollbar is drawn) in object-centered coordinates
- An array of two `f32` values representing the start and end positions of the thumb along the scrollbar axis

The implementation correctly accounts for content insets (padding) and uses object-centered coordinates where (0,0) is the center of the UI node. This is consistent with how other UI geometry is represented in Bevy. The thumb position calculation is handled by a private helper function `compute_thumb()` that implements the standard scrollbar thumb sizing formula: the thumb length is proportional to the visible area relative to the total content.

What's particularly effective about this implementation is how it leverages existing computed properties. The `ComputedNode` already contains `scrollbar_size`, `content_size`, `scroll_position`, and `content_inset()` methods, so the new functions don't need to perform any new layout calculations—they just transform these existing values into a more usable format.

The tests demonstrate thorough coverage of edge cases: both scrollbars present, only horizontal, only vertical, and different scroll positions. The tests verify the exact pixel coordinates match expectations, which is crucial for scrollbar interaction code that needs precise hit testing.

This change is minimal and focused, adding only the necessary functionality without over-engineering. It follows Rust conventions well, using `Option` for conditional returns and providing clear, focused methods that do one thing well. The implementation could serve as a foundation for future scrollbar interaction features in Bevy's UI system.

## Key Files Changed

**File: `crates/bevy_ui/src/ui_node.rs` (+170/-0)**

This is the only file modified in this PR. The changes add two public methods and a private helper function to the `ComputedNode` implementation block, along with comprehensive test coverage.

The key additions are:

1. **Private helper function `compute_thumb`**:
```rust
const fn compute_thumb(
    gutter_min: f32,
    content_length: f32,
    gutter_length: f32,
    scroll_position: f32,
) -> [f32; 2] {
    if content_length <= gutter_length {
        return [gutter_min, gutter_min + gutter_length];
    }
    let thumb_len = gutter_length * gutter_length / content_length;
    let thumb_min = gutter_min + scroll_position * gutter_length / content_length;
    [thumb_min, thumb_min + thumb_len]
}
```

This function calculates the thumb position along one axis. The formula `thumb_len = gutter_length * gutter_length / content_length` ensures the thumb size is proportional to the visible area relative to total content. The condition `if content_length <= gutter_length` handles the case where all content is visible (no effective scrolling needed), making the thumb fill the entire gutter.

2. **Public method `horizontal_scrollbar`**:
```rust
pub fn horizontal_scrollbar(&self) -> Option<(Rect, [f32; 2])> {
    if self.scrollbar_size.y <= 0. {
        return None;
    }
    let content_inset = self.content_inset();
    let half_size = 0.5 * self.size;
    let min_x = -half_size.x + content_inset.left;
    let max_x = half_size.x - content_inset.right - self.scrollbar_size.x;
    let max_y = half_size.y - content_inset.bottom;
    let min_y = max_y - self.scrollbar_size.y;
    let gutter = Rect {
        min: Vec2::new(min_x, min_y),
        max: Vec2::new(max_x, max_y),
    };
    Some((
        gutter,
        Self::compute_thumb(
            gutter.min.x,
            self.content_size.x,
            gutter.size().x,
            self.scroll_position.x,
        ),
    ))
}
```

This method computes the horizontal scrollbar geometry. It returns `None` if the scrollbar height (`scrollbar_size.y`) is zero or negative. The calculations account for content insets and position the scrollbar at the bottom of the node.

3. **Public method `vertical_scrollbar`**:
```rust
pub fn vertical_scrollbar(&self) -> Option<(Rect, [f32; 2])> {
    if self.scrollbar_size.x <= 0. {
        return None;
    }
    let content_inset = self.content_inset();
    let half_size = 0.5 * self.size;
    let max_x = half_size.x - content_inset.right;
    let min_x = max_x - self.scrollbar_size.x;
    let min_y = -half_size.y + content_inset.top;
    let max_y = half_size.y - content_inset.bottom - self.scrollbar_size.y;
    let gutter = Rect {
        min: Vec2::new(min_x, min_y),
        max: Vec2::new(max_x, max_y),
    };
    Some((
        gutter,
        Self::compute_thumb(
            gutter.min.y,
            self.content_size.y,
            gutter.size().y,
            self.scroll_position.y,
        ),
    ))
}
```

This is the vertical counterpart, checking `scrollbar_size.x` for width and positioning the scrollbar on the right side of the node.

4. **Test functions**: Four comprehensive test cases verify the calculations for various scenarios including both scrollbars, single scrollbars, and different scroll positions.
