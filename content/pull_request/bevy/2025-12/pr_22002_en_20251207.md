## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a straightforward formatting issue in the Bevy game engine's window handling code. During routine development or code review, the author noticed an inconsistent whitespace pattern in the definition of the `CursorIcon` enum. While this change doesn't affect functionality, it demonstrates the importance of maintaining consistent code style across a large codebase.

The issue was located in the `cursor/mod.rs` file within the `bevy_window` crate. The `CursorIcon` enum, which defines various cursor styles including custom cursors, had an extra newline between the `#[cfg_attr]` attribute and the `pub enum CursorIcon` declaration. This formatting inconsistency, while minor, could affect code readability and consistency with the project's style guidelines.

The solution was simple: remove the single extra newline character. This change brings the code into alignment with typical Rust formatting conventions where attributes are placed directly above the item they annotate without intervening blank lines. In Rust, `#[cfg_attr]` is a conditional attribute that conditionally includes other attributes based on feature flags, and maintaining clean spacing around such attributes improves code scanability.

This type of change falls into the category of code hygiene or minor cleanup. While individually trivial, consistent application of such improvements across a codebase contributes to overall code quality and maintainability. The PR was appropriately labeled as "D-Trivial" and "S-Ready-For-Final-Review", indicating both its minimal scope and that it was ready for merging after review.

The technical insight here relates to how large codebases maintain consistency. Even small formatting issues can accumulate over time, leading to visual noise that makes code reviews more difficult. Automated formatting tools like `rustfmt` help with many such issues, but they may not catch all spacing inconsistencies, particularly when attributes with conditional compilation are involved.

The impact of this change is minimal but positive. It reduces visual clutter and maintains consistency with the surrounding code. For developers reading or modifying this enum in the future, the cleaner formatting makes the structure slightly easier to parse at a glance. This aligns with common engineering practices where even minor improvements to code clarity are worthwhile when they require minimal effort.

## Key Files Changed

**File**: `crates/bevy_window/src/cursor/mod.rs`

This file contains the cursor handling functionality for Bevy's window system. The `CursorIcon` enum defines various cursor styles that can be used in applications, including standard system cursors and custom cursor images when the `custom_cursor` feature is enabled.

**Change**: Removed an extra newline between the `#[cfg_attr]` attribute and the `CursorIcon` enum declaration.

**Before**:
```rust
#[cfg_attr(
    feature = "bevy_reflect",
    derive(Reflect),
    reflect(Component, Debug, Default, PartialEq, Clone)
)]

pub enum CursorIcon {
```

**After**:
```rust
#[cfg_attr(
    feature = "bevy_reflect",
    derive(Reflect),
    reflect(Component, Debug, Default, PartialEq, Clone)
)]
pub enum CursorIcon {
```

The change simply removes the blank line between the closing `)]` of the `#[cfg_attr]` attribute and the `pub enum CursorIcon` declaration, bringing it in line with typical Rust formatting where attributes appear directly above the items they modify.
