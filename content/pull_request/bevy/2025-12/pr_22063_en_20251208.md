<h2>[0.12.0] - 2025-11-12</h2>
<h3>API Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Breaking: Removed the <code>ron::error::Error::Base64Error</code> variant. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/566">#566</a>)</li>
<li>Added <code>into_inner()</code> method to <code>ron::ser::Serializer</code> to retrieve the inner writer. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/588">#588</a>)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Format Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Format-Breaking:</strong> Remote base64-encoded byte strings deserialisation, replaced by Rusty byte strings in v0.9.0 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/566">#566</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed untagged enum deserialisation for serde &gt;= 1.0.220 with better serde content detection (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/582">#582</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.11.0] - 2025-08-27</h2>

With default features disabled, you must enable the <code>std</code> feature to access <code>de::from_reader</code>, and the <code>std::io</code> operations on <code>Options</code>, such as <code>from_reader</code>, <code>from_reader_seed</code>, <code>to_io_writer</code>, and <code>to_io_writer_pretty</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/567">#567</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: Fixed (again) <code>ron::value::Number</code> to ensure it is non-exhaustive, to avoid breaking <code>match</code>es when feature unification enables more of its variants than expected (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/568">#568</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>

<h3>API Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>ron::Options::to_io_writer</code> and <code>ron::Options::to_io_writer_pretty</code> to allow writing into an <code>io::Writer</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/561">#561</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: <code>ron::value::Number</code> is now non-exhaustive, to avoid breaking <code>match</code>es when feature unification enables more of its variants than expected (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/564">#564</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.9.0] - 2025-03-18</h2>
<h3>API Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>ron::value::RawValue</code> helper type which can (de)serialize any valid RON (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/407">#407</a>)</li>
<li>Add <code>escape_strings</code> option to <code>PrettyConfig</code> to allow serialising with or without escaping (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/426">#426</a>)</li>
<li>Add <code>compact_maps</code> and <code>compact_structs</code> options to <code>PrettyConfig</code> to allow serialising maps and structs on a single line (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/448">#448</a>)</li>
<li>Add minimal support for <code>#[serde(flatten)]</code> with roundtripping through RON maps (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/455">#455</a>)</li>
<li>Add minimal roundtripping support for <code>#[serde(tag = &quot;tag&quot;)]</code>, <code>#[serde(tag = &quot;tag&quot;, content = &quot;content&quot;)]</code>, and <code>#[serde(untagged)]</code> enums (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/451">#451</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: Expand the <code>value::Number</code> enum to explicitly encode all possible number types (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/479">#479</a>)</li>
<li>Add <code>number_suffixes</code> option to <code>PrettyConfig</code> to allow serialising numbers with their explicit type suffix, e.g. <code>42i32</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/481">#481</a>)</li>
<li>Allow <code>ron::value::RawValue</code> to capture any whitespace to the left and right of a ron value (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/487">#487</a>)</li>
<li>Breaking: Enforce that ron always writes valid UTF-8 (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/488">#488</a>)</li>
<li>Add convenient <code>Value::from</code> impls (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/498">#498</a>)</li>
<li>Add new extension <code>explicit_struct_names</code> which requires that struct names are included during deserialization (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/ron-rs/ron/pull/522">#522</a>)</li>

## The Story of This Pull Request

This is a routine dependency maintenance PR created by Dependabot, the automated dependency management service. The PR updates Bevy's dependency on the RON (Rusty Object Notation) crate from version 0.11 to 0.12 across multiple locations in the codebase. RON is a data serialization format similar to JSON but designed to be more readable for humans while maintaining support for Rust data structures.

The primary challenge with dependency updates like this is ensuring backward compatibility and verifying that the breaking changes in the new version don't affect the existing codebase. According to the release notes, RON 0.12 includes several important changes:
1. **Breaking API changes**: Removal of the `ron::error::Error::Base64Error` variant and the `base64` dependency
2. **Format-breaking changes**: Complete removal of base64-encoded byte strings deserialization support
3. **Bug fixes**: Improved serde content detection for untagged enum deserialization
4. **New features**: Addition of `Serializer::into_inner()` method

The key technical consideration here is that RON 0.12 removes support for base64-encoded byte strings, which had been deprecated since version 0.9.0 and replaced with "Rusty byte strings." Bevy needs to ensure that it's not using this deprecated feature in any of its serialization code. The fact that this PR was merged without requiring any code changes beyond the version bump suggests that Bevy was already using the newer format or wasn't using byte string serialization at all.

The implementation approach is straightforward: update the version string in all `Cargo.toml` files that reference the RON dependency. This includes both direct dependencies and dev-dependencies. The changes are minimal but widespread, affecting 5 different crates within the Bevy ecosystem. Each crate uses RON for different purposes:
- `bevy_animation`: For animation data serialization
- `bevy_asset`: For asset metadata and configuration
- `bevy_dev_tools`: For development tool configuration (optional feature)
- `bevy_reflect`: For reflection and serialization testing
- `bevy_scene`: For scene serialization (optional feature)

The maintenance of dependencies like RON is critical for several reasons:
1. **Security**: Updated dependencies often include security patches
2. **Bug fixes**: New versions fix known issues in the library
3. **Performance**: Optimizations in the dependency can improve overall system performance
4. **Compatibility**: Staying current with dependencies helps maintain compatibility with other libraries in the Rust ecosystem

The automated nature of this PR demonstrates the value of tools like Dependabot in managing dependency updates in large projects. The PR was quickly reviewed and merged within 1.5 hours of creation, indicating that the Bevy maintainers have confidence in both the RON upgrade and their test suite's ability to catch any potential issues.

# Before:
# other
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"], optional = true }
ron = { version = "0.11", optional = true }
tracing = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }

# After:
# other
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"], optional = true }
ron = { version = "0.12", optional = true }
tracing = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }
```

bincode = { version = "2.0", features = ["serde"] }
serde_json = "1.0.140"

# After:
[dev-dependencies]
ron = "0.12"
rmp-serde = "1.1"
bincode = { version = "2.0", features = ["serde"] }
serde_json = "1.0.140"
```

### `crates/bevy_scene/Cargo.toml`
This crate uses RON as an optional dependency for scene serialization, maintaining the disabled default features.

```toml
# File: crates/bevy_scene/Cargo.toml
# Before:
# other
ron = { version = "0.11", default-features = false, optional = true }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"], optional = true }
uuid = { version = "1.13.1", features = ["v4"] }

# After:
# other
ron = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, optional = true }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"], optional = true }
