## Solution

- Change the order between the lint and the safety comment

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a straightforward but important Clippy lint violation that occurs when building for WebAssembly targets. The problem was discovered when running Clippy with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target on the `bevy_reflect` crate, which is a critical part of Bevy's reflection system. The error message clearly indicated that an unsafe block was missing a required safety comment.

Looking at the code, the issue wasn't that the safety comment was missing entirely - it was actually present and well-documented. The problem was that the comment was placed in the wrong position relative to the `#[expect(...)]` attribute that was suppressing a different Clippy warning. In Rust, the `#[expect(...)]` attribute (and similar lint control attributes) must come immediately before the item they're modifying, which in this case was the unsafe block. The safety comment, which explains why the unsafe code is safe, must come immediately before the `unsafe` keyword.

The code originally had this structure:
1. Safety comment explaining the rationale
2. `#[expect(...)]` attribute for the `unsafe_code` lint
3. The `unsafe` block

This ordering caused Clippy to see the `#[expect(...)]` attribute between the safety comment and the unsafe block, making it appear as though the safety comment was missing from Clippy's perspective.

The fix was simple but important: swap the positions of the `#[expect(...)]` attribute and the safety comment. This places the safety comment immediately before the `unsafe` block where Clippy expects to find it, while keeping the `#[expect(...)]` attribute properly positioned to suppress the `unsafe_code` lint warning.

This is a good example of how Rust's tooling enforces best practices around unsafe code. Even though the safety explanation was present, its placement mattered for tooling compliance. The fix ensures that:
1. Developers have the necessary safety documentation when reviewing unsafe code
2. The code passes Clippy checks for all supported targets, including WebAssembly
3. The `#[expect(...)]` attribute continues to properly suppress the intended warning

The PR was quickly reviewed and merged, indicating that this was a clear-cut fix that followed established Rust conventions. It's worth noting that WebAssembly builds have some unique considerations, particularly around constructor initialization, which the safety comment specifically addresses with a link to the `inventory` crate's WebAssembly documentation.

## Key Files Changed

**File:** `crates/bevy_reflect/src/lib.rs`

This file contains the main reflection logic for Bevy. The change was in the `__macro_exports` module, specifically in an initialization function for WebAssembly targets.

**Before:**
```rust
// SAFETY:
// This will call constructors on wasm platforms at most once (as long as `init` is the only function that calls `__wasm_call_ctors`).
//
// For more information see: https://docs.rs/inventory/latest/inventory/#webassembly-and-constructors
#[expect(
    unsafe_code,
    reason = "This function must be called to use inventory on wasm."
)]
unsafe {
    __wasm_call_ctors();
}
```

**After:**
```rust
#[expect(
    unsafe_code,
    reason = "This function must be called to use inventory on wasm."
)]
// SAFETY:
// This will call constructors on wasm platforms at most once (as long as `init` is the only function that calls `__wasm_call_ctors`).
//
// For more information see: https://docs.rs/inventory/latest/inventory/#webassembly-and-constructors
unsafe {
    __wasm_call_ctors();
}
```

**Change Explanation:**
The change simply reorders two lines of documentation/attributes. The `#[expect(...)]` attribute is moved before the `// SAFETY:` comment. This ensures Clippy sees the safety comment immediately preceding the unsafe block, satisfying its requirements while maintaining the intended suppression of the `unsafe_code` lint warning.
