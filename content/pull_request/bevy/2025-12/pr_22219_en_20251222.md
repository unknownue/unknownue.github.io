## Description Translation
# Objective

In the text example, feature gate only the `font` argument instead of the component bundle.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request addresses a specific code quality issue in one of Bevy's UI examples. The `text` example in the `examples/ui/` directory was conditionally compiling different component bundles based on whether the `default_font` feature was enabled. The original implementation used runtime conditional compilation with `if cfg!(feature = "default_font")` to create two different component bundles, which led to code duplication and reduced maintainability.

The problem stemmed from how the example handled font loading when the `default_font` feature wasn't available. When the feature was enabled, the code would use the default font by not specifying a `font` field in the `TextFont` component. When the feature was disabled, it needed to explicitly load a font asset using `asset_server.load("fonts/FiraMono-Medium.ttf")`. The original approach created two separate but nearly identical component tuples, differing only in the `font` field of the `TextFont` component.

The developer identified that this pattern could be simplified by applying conditional compilation directly at the field level rather than at the bundle level. By using `#[cfg(not(feature = "default_font"))]` attribute on the `font` field specifically, the same component tuple could be used in both scenarios. When the feature is disabled, the `font` field is included and initialized with the loaded font asset. When the feature is enabled, the `font` field is omitted entirely, allowing the default font to be used.

This approach follows Rust's conditional compilation patterns more idiomatically. Instead of using `cfg!()` macro which evaluates at runtime and creates two separate code paths, the `#[cfg(...)]` attribute conditionally includes or excludes code at compile time. This reduces the binary size slightly since only one code path is compiled, and it eliminates the duplication of the common parts of the component bundle.

The implementation change is straightforward but demonstrates good attention to code quality. The refactored code is more concise (reduced from 20 lines to 10 lines in the changed section) and more maintainable. If future changes need to be made to the `TextFont` component or the surrounding bundle, they only need to be made in one place rather than two.

From an engineering perspective, this change also improves clarity. The comment about the default font behavior is now placed directly adjacent to the field it describes, making the code easier to understand. The relationship between the feature flag and the font loading is more explicit and localized.

This type of refactoring is particularly valuable in example code, which serves as both documentation and reference implementation for developers learning the Bevy framework. Clean, idiomatic examples help establish best practices for the community and make the codebase more approachable for new contributors.

## Key Files Changed

### `examples/ui/text.rs` (+10/-20)

This file contains the UI text example that demonstrates text rendering capabilities in Bevy. The change refactors how the example handles conditional font loading based on the `default_font` feature flag.

**Before:**
```rust
.with_child((
    TextSpan::default(),
    if cfg!(feature = "default_font") {
        (
            TextFont {
                font_size: 33.0,
                // If no font is specified, the default font (a minimal subset of FiraMono) will be used.
                ..default()
            },
            TextColor(GOLD.into()),
        )
    } else {
        (
            // "default_font" feature is unavailable, load a font to use instead.
            TextFont {
                font: asset_server.load("fonts/FiraMono-Medium.ttf"),
                font_size: 33.0,
                ..Default::default()
            },
            TextColor(GOLD.into()),
        )
    },
    FpsText,
));
```

**After:**
```rust
.with_child((
    TextSpan::default(),
    (
        TextFont {
            // If the "default_font" feature is unavailable, load a font to use instead.
            #[cfg(not(feature = "default_font"))]
            font: asset_server.load("fonts/FiraMono-Medium.ttf"),
            font_size: 33.0,
            ..Default::default()
        },
        TextColor(GOLD.into()),
    ),
    FpsText,
));
```

The change replaces a runtime conditional with a compile-time attribute on the specific field that varies. This eliminates code duplication and makes the example more concise and maintainable. The comment is also repositioned to be adjacent to the conditional field it describes.
