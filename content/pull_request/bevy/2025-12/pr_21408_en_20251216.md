## Description Translation
This is related to #21384

# Objective

The goal of this change is to enable `EntityEvent` to work with any Entity-like type which implements `ContainsEntity`.

## Solution

- Change return type of `EntityEvent::event_target` from `Entity` to `&impl ContainsEntity`
- Change all appropriate call sites to use `event_target().entity()` instead of `event_target()`
- Refactor `EntityEvent::event_target_mut` into `EntityEvent::set_event_target`

I'm not fully happy with this solution yet, but I'm opening the PR to discuss the options from here.

Mainly the issue revolves around `set_event_target`. To make this work, we need the underlying type to be constructible from an entity. This may not always be safe from user's perspective (it wouldn't be with `Instance<T>` for example).

Based on my understanding of the system, an event's target is only mutated in the case of event propagation, which makes sense.

To work around this, I propose that we flag `EntityEvents` as **immutable** or not; or "not propagatable" or not (I'm open to other terminology! :P).

This would allow us to implement `set_event_target` as `unreachable()!` and throw an error instead if the user tries to propagate such an event. We could even maybe enforce this compile time but it'll require additional complexity (mostly in form of different permutations of `trigger_*` method family).

## Testing

- Added `test_derive_entity_event` to cover all permutations

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a limitation in Bevy's ECS event system where `EntityEvent` types were hardcoded to work only with raw `Entity` types. This prevented using "kinded entities" or other wrapper types that implement the `ContainsEntity` trait. The core problem was that `EntityEvent::event_target()` returned a direct `Entity` value, and `event_target_mut()` returned a mutable reference to an `Entity`, making the system inflexible for custom entity-like types.

The developer recognized that event targets are only mutated during event propagation. This insight led to a separation of concerns: most entity events don't need mutability, but propagation requires it. The solution introduced a new trait `SetEntityEventTarget` for events that support target mutation, while making all entity events immutable by default.

The implementation changes `EntityEvent::event_target()` to return `Entity` by calling `ContainsEntity::entity()` on the underlying field. This allows any type implementing `ContainsEntity` to be used as an event target. The previously mutable method `event_target_mut()` was removed and replaced with `SetEntityEventTarget::set_event_target()` which takes an `Entity` parameter.

A key design decision was making entity events immutable by default. Events that need propagation must explicitly opt-in using the `#[entity_event(propagate)]` attribute. When this attribute is present, the derive macro automatically implements `SetEntityEventTarget` for the event type. The implementation assumes the underlying type can be constructed from an `Entity` via `Into::into(entity)`.

The propagation system in `trigger.rs` was updated to require events to implement `SetEntityEventTarget` when using propagation triggers. This ensures type safety - trying to propagate an event that doesn't implement `SetEntityEventTarget` will fail at compile time.

This change enables more expressive event systems. Developers can now create events with typed entity wrappers like `Instance<T>` or custom ID types, while maintaining the ability to propagate events when needed. The migration is straightforward: events that previously used `event_target_mut()` now need to implement `SetEntityEventTarget`, which is automatically done for propagated events.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/event/mod.rs` (+163/-3)
This file contains the core trait definitions and the comprehensive test suite. The main changes include:
1. Updated `EntityEvent` trait documentation with examples using `ContainsEntity`
2. Added new `SetEntityEventTarget` trait for mutable event targets
3. Added comprehensive test `test_derive_entity_event` covering all permutations

Key code changes:
```rust
// Before:
pub trait EntityEvent: Event {
    fn event_target(&self) -> Entity;
    fn event_target_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Entity;
}

// After:
pub trait EntityEvent: Event {
    fn event_target(&self) -> Entity;
}

pub trait SetEntityEventTarget: EntityEvent {
    fn set_event_target(&mut self, entity: Entity);
}
```

The test demonstrates various event configurations including different field types and propagation attributes.

### `crates/bevy_ecs/macros/src/event.rs` (+15/-5)
The macro was updated to conditionally implement `SetEntityEventTarget` for events with the `propagate` attribute:

```rust
let set_entity_event_target_impl = if propagate {
    quote! {
        impl #impl_generics #bevy_ecs_path::event::SetEntityEventTarget for #struct_name #type_generics #where_clause {
            fn set_event_target(&mut self, entity: #bevy_ecs_path::entity::Entity) {
                self.#entity_field = Into::into(entity);
            }
        }
    }
} else {
    quote! {}
};
```

This ensures that only events marked with `#[entity_event(propagate)]` get the mutable setter implementation.

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/event/trigger.rs` (+3/-2)
The propagation trigger was updated to use the new `set_event_target` method instead of the old mutable reference approach:

```rust
// Before:
*event.event_target_mut() = current_entity;

// After:
event.set_event_target(current_entity);
```

The trait bound was also updated to require `SetEntityEventTarget` for propagatable events.

### `release-content/migration-guides/immutable-entity-events.md` (+11/-0)
This new migration guide explains the change to users:

```markdown
The mutable methods of `EntityEvent` (`EntityEvent::from` and `EntityEvent::event_target_mut`)
have been moved to a separate trait: `SetEntityEventTarget`

This makes all `EntityEvents` immutable by default.

`SetEntityEventTarget` is implemented automatically for propagated events (e.g. `#[entity_event(propagate)]`).
```
