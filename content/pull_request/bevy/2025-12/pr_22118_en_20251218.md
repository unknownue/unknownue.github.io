## The Story of This Pull Request

This is a straightforward dependency update PR generated automatically by GitHub's Dependabot service. The action `actions/download-artifact` is a critical component in GitHub Actions workflows, responsible for downloading artifacts that were previously uploaded by other jobs in the workflow.

The GitHub Actions ecosystem follows semantic versioning, and version 7 of `actions/download-artifact` represents a major version bump from version 6. The primary change in this release is the migration from Node.js 20 to Node.js 24 as the default runtime environment. This update is part of GitHub's ongoing effort to keep their actions running on supported Node.js versions, ensuring compatibility with newer JavaScript features and receiving security updates.

For projects like Bevy that use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, maintaining up-to-date action dependencies is important for several reasons. First, it ensures the workflow runs on a supported Node.js version, which is important for security. Second, it can provide performance improvements and bug fixes that come with newer versions of the underlying dependencies. Third, staying current helps avoid technical debt where outdated dependencies might eventually break as GitHub's infrastructure evolves.

The update from v6 to v7 requires a minimum Actions Runner version of 2.327.1. This is a critical consideration for teams using self-hosted runners, as they need to ensure their runner software is updated before upgrading to v7. For GitHub-hosted runners, this requirement is automatically satisfied since GitHub maintains the runner infrastructure.

One technical detail in the release notes is the mention of fixing Node.js 24 punycode deprecation. This refers to addressing deprecation warnings or compatibility issues with the punycode module in Node.js 24, which helps keep the action logs clean and prevents potential future breakages.

The PR was automatically created by Dependabot, which monitors dependency files in repositories and creates PRs when updates are available. Dependabot's compatibility score feature indicated that this update was compatible with the existing usage, giving confidence that the update could be applied without breaking changes to the workflow logic.

The Bevy maintainers reviewed this PR and merged it after confirming the CI passed. The merge was straightforward because the change only involved updating the version number in one location, and the compatibility was verified through automated testing. This kind of maintenance update is essential for keeping the CI/CD pipeline reliable and secure, though it doesn't introduce new features or change the game engine's functionality.

## Key Files Changed

Only one file was modified in this PR:

### `.github/workflows/send-screenshots-to-pixeleagle.yml` (+1/-1)

This is a GitHub Actions workflow file that handles sending screenshots to an external service (Pixeleagle) for visualization or testing purposes. The workflow downloads a build artifact containing screenshots before processing or uploading them.

The change is minimal - updating the `actions/download-artifact` action from version 6 to version 7:

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/send-screenshots-to-pixeleagle.yml
# Before:
- name: Download artifact
  if: ${{ fromJSON(env.PIXELEAGLE_TOKEN_EXISTS) }}
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v6
  with:
    pattern: ${{ inputs.artifact }}

# After:
- name: Download artifact
  if: ${{ fromJSON(env.PIXELEAGLE_TOKEN_EXISTS) }}
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v7
  with:
    pattern: ${{ inputs.artifact }}
```

The update ensures this workflow step uses the latest version of the download-artifact action with Node.js 24 support. The workflow logic remains identical - it only downloads the artifact when the `PIXELEAGLE_TOKEN_EXISTS` environment variable indicates that the necessary token is available for uploading to Pixeleagle.

This change is part of routine maintenance to keep GitHub Actions workflows up-to-date with the latest action versions, ensuring compatibility and security.
