## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR represents a routine but important dependency maintenance task. Dependabot, an automated dependency update tool, detected that the `toml_edit` library had released version 0.24.0 and created this pull request to update Bevy's dependencies accordingly.

The `toml_edit` library is used for parsing and manipulating TOML configuration files. In the Bevy project, it's employed in three distinct areas: the `bevy_macro_utils` crate and two build tools (`build-templated-pages` and `example-showcase`). These components use `toml_edit` specifically for parsing TOML files with the `parse` feature enabled and with default features disabled to minimize dependencies.

Looking at the `toml_edit` changelog reveals this is a significant update that includes support for TOML 1.1, which introduces several new language features. The version bump from 0.23.2 to 0.24.0 indicates there may be breaking changes (as suggested by the exclamation marks in the commit messages), including changes to the `set_position(None)` API and support for multi-line inline tables with trailing commas.

For Bevy, the update is straightforward because the project uses `toml_edit` in a limited capacity with specific feature flags. The fact that all three uses disable default features and only enable the `parse` feature suggests Bevy is primarily using the library for TOML parsing rather than complex manipulation. This limited usage pattern likely makes the update lower risk, as breaking changes in other parts of the API wouldn't affect Bevy's code.

The PR was automatically created by Dependabot, which monitors dependency versions and creates updates when new versions are available. This automation is crucial for maintaining security and accessing new features while minimizing manual maintenance overhead. The PR description includes standard Dependabot commands that project maintainers can use to control the update process.

The update was merged relatively quickly (within about 14 hours), suggesting that the CI tests passed without issues and the maintainers were confident in the compatibility of the new version. This quick merge indicates that either Bevy's usage of `toml_edit` doesn't interact with the breaking changes, or the project's test suite provides sufficient confidence that the update is safe.

From an engineering perspective, this PR demonstrates good dependency management practices: using automated tooling for updates, specifying feature flags precisely to limit API surface exposure, and maintaining a comprehensive test suite that can quickly validate compatibility with new dependency versions.

### `crates/bevy_macro_utils/Cargo.toml`
This crate provides utility functions for Bevy's procedural macros and needs TOML parsing capabilities for reading configuration files.

```toml
# File: crates/bevy_macro_utils/Cargo.toml
# Before:
toml_edit = { version = "0.23.2", default-features = false, features = [
  "parse",
] }

# After:
toml_edit = { version = "0.24.0", default-features = false, features = [
  "parse",
] }
```

### `tools/build-templated-pages/Cargo.toml`
This build tool generates documentation pages and uses TOML parsing for configuration.

```toml
# File: tools/build-templated-pages/Cargo.toml
# Before:
toml_edit = { version = "0.23.2", default-features = false, features = [
  "parse",
] }

# After:
toml_edit = { version = "0.24.0", default-features = false, features = [
  "parse",
] }
```

### `tools/example-showcase/Cargo.toml`
This tool manages Bevy examples and uses TOML parsing for reading example metadata.

```toml
# File: tools/example-showcase/Cargo.toml
# Before:
toml_edit = { version = "0.23.2", default-features = false, features = [
  "parse",
] }

# After:
toml_edit = { version = "0.24.0", default-features = false, features = [
  "parse",
] }
```

All three changes are identical: they update the version constraint from `0.23.2` to `0.24.0` while preserving the same feature configuration. This consistency shows that all components use `toml_edit` for the same basic TOML parsing functionality.
