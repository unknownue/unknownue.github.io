## The Story of This Pull Request

This is a straightforward dependency update PR generated by Dependabot. The change updates the `peter-evans/create-pull-request` GitHub Action from version 7 to version 8 in Bevy's post-release workflow.

The post-release workflow is triggered after new releases to automate the process of updating version references in documentation and examples. It uses the `create-pull-request` action to automatically generate a PR with these updates. This automation ensures that documentation stays current without requiring manual intervention from maintainers.

The update from v7 to v8 is a major version bump, which typically indicates breaking changes. According to the release notes, the primary change in v8 is the requirement for Actions Runner v2.327.1 or later when using self-hosted runners, due to Node 24 support. For GitHub-hosted runners, this requirement is automatically satisfied, so the impact on Bevy's workflow is minimal.

The version update also includes internal updates within the action itself, particularly updating its own dependency on `actions/checkout` to v6. This ensures compatibility with the latest versions of GitHub's core actions. The v7.0.9 release of `create-pull-request` specifically addressed an incompatibility with `actions/checkout@v6`, so moving to v8 maintains this compatibility.

This type of dependency update is routine maintenance. Dependabot automatically monitors dependencies and creates PRs when new versions are available. The Bevy maintainers have labeled this PR as "Uncontroversial" and "Straightforward," indicating it's a safe update that follows standard practices. The PR was merged after three days, which is typical for dependency updates that don't require extensive testing beyond the existing CI pipeline.
