## Description Translation
RenderTarget was a Component that derived Reflect but did not Reflect Component

as of this merge today: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/67633b34da677a825ea3c6900b884d012d56999b

Without this fix, spawning a scene with a camera (such as from a Blender export) causes a panic:

> scene contains the unregistered component `bevy_camera::camera::RenderTarget`. consider adding `#[reflect(Component)]` to your type

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a straightforward but important issue in Bevy's reflection system. The `RenderTarget` component was missing proper reflection metadata, which caused a panic when deserializing scenes containing cameras with explicit render targets.

The problem manifested when users attempted to spawn scenes exported from tools like Blender that contained cameras. When Bevy's scene deserialization system encountered a `RenderTarget` component, it couldn't find the necessary reflection metadata to properly instantiate the component. The error message was clear: "scene contains the unregistered component `bevy_camera::camera::RenderTarget`. consider adding `#[reflect(Component)]` to your type."

The root cause was that `RenderTarget` already derived the `Reflect` trait and had `#[reflect(Clone)]` attribute, but it was missing the `#[reflect(Component)]` attribute. This meant that while the type itself could be reflected for cloning purposes, it wasn't registered as a component in Bevy's reflection system.

The solution was simple but critical: add the missing `#[reflect(Component)]` attribute to the `RenderTarget` enum definition. This single-line change ensured that `RenderTarget` would be properly registered as a reflectable component, allowing scenes containing cameras with render targets to be deserialized without errors.

The implementation approach demonstrates Bevy's attribute-based reflection system. By adding `#[reflect(Component)]`, the code generation during compilation creates the necessary metadata to register `RenderTarget` as a component type in the reflection registry. This metadata includes information about the component's fields, methods, and how to construct instances, which the scene deserialization system uses to properly instantiate components from serialized data.

From a technical perspective, this fix highlights the importance of consistency in reflection annotations. When a type derives `Component` and `Reflect`, it typically needs `#[reflect(Component)]` to ensure it's properly registered. The `#[reflect(Clone)]` attribute handles cloning via reflection, but doesn't register the type as a component.

The impact of this change is significant for users working with scene serialization and deserialization. Without this fix, any scene containing a camera with an explicit render target would fail to load, breaking workflows that involve exporting scenes from external tools or saving/loading game states. The fix ensures that Bevy's reflection system works consistently across all component types.

This type of issue is common in reflection-based systems where metadata registration is required for each type that needs to participate in runtime type operations. The straightforward solution serves as a good example of how to properly annotate components for reflection in Bevy's ECS architecture.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_camera/src/camera.rs` (+1/-1)

This file contains the definition of the `RenderTarget` enum. The change adds the `Component` parameter to the `#[reflect(...)]` attribute, ensuring that `RenderTarget` is properly registered as a reflectable component.

**Key Modification:**
```rust
// File: crates/bevy_camera/src/camera.rs
// Before:
#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone, Reflect, From)]
#[reflect(Clone)]
pub enum RenderTarget {
    Window(WindowRef),
    Image(Handle<Image>),
}

// After:
#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone, Reflect, From)]
#[reflect(Clone, Component)]  // Added Component to reflect attributes
pub enum RenderTarget {
    Window(WindowRef),
    Image(Handle<Image>),
}
```

The change is minimal but crucial. The `RenderTarget` enum was already derived from `Component` and `Reflect`, but without `#[reflect(Component)]`, it wasn't being registered in Bevy's reflection registry. This registration is necessary for the scene system to properly deserialize components from saved scenes.

The fix ensures that when scenes containing cameras with `RenderTarget` components are loaded, the reflection system can properly instantiate and register these components, preventing the panic that occurred when trying to spawn scenes from external tools like Blender.
