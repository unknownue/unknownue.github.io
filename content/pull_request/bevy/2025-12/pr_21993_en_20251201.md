## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request represents a routine dependency update in the Bevy engine's continuous integration (CI) pipeline. The PR was automatically generated by Dependabot, a GitHub feature that monitors project dependencies and creates pull requests to keep them current. In this case, the dependency is the `crate-ci/typos` GitHub Action, a tool used to check for spelling errors in the codebase.

The core issue addressed here is maintaining code quality through automated spell-checking. Spelling errors in code comments, documentation, and even variable names can create confusion for developers and negatively impact the project's professionalism. The `typos` tool helps catch these errors early in the development process by running as part of the CI pipeline.

The solution approach is straightforward: update the version reference in the CI configuration file. Version 1.40.0 of `crate-ci/typos` was released on November 26, 2025, and includes dictionary updates from the November 2025 changes. These dictionary updates are the primary feature of this release, meaning the tool will have an expanded vocabulary for checking spelling and potentially reduced false positives.

The implementation is minimal, consisting of a single line change in the CI workflow file. The change updates the version tag from `v1.39.2` to `v1.40.0`. This ensures that when the CI job runs, it uses the latest version of the typos checker with the updated dictionary.

From a technical perspective, this update demonstrates the importance of keeping development tooling current. The dictionary updates in typos 1.40.0 improve the tool's accuracy by adding new valid words and potentially fixing previous false positives. This helps maintain the quality of the codebase without requiring manual intervention from developers.

The impact of this change is limited to the CI pipeline's spell-checking step. After merging, all subsequent CI runs will use version 1.40.0 of the typos tool. This provides incremental improvements in spell-checking accuracy but doesn't affect the actual Bevy engine code or runtime behavior. The PR was merged quickly (within 49 minutes) because it's a low-risk dependency update with a perfect compatibility score, as indicated by the Dependabot badge.

## Key Files Changed

### File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

This file contains the GitHub Actions workflow configuration for Bevy's continuous integration pipeline. The change updates the version of the `crate-ci/typos` action used in the spell-checking job.

**Key modification:**
```yaml
# Before:
      - name: Check for typos
        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.39.2

# After:
      - name: Check for typos
        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.40.0
```

**Explanation:**
The change updates the GitHub Action reference from version 1.39.2 to 1.40.0. This is located in the "typos" job within the CI workflow. When this job runs, it now executes the newer version of the typos tool with the updated dictionary. The rest of the workflow remains unchanged.

This single-line change is the entirety of the PR's modifications. It demonstrates how minor dependency updates can be handled efficiently through automated tooling like Dependabot.
