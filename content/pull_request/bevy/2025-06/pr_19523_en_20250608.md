## PR Analysis: deny(missing_docs) for bevy_ecs_macros

### The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a specific documentation gap in Bevy's ECS macros crate. The core problem was straightforward: `bevy_ecs_macros` lacked comprehensive documentation coverage, making it difficult for contributors to understand its functionality and violating Bevy's long-term documentation goals established in issue #3492.

The solution approach was practical and focused: enable Rust's `deny(missing_docs)` lint to enforce documentation requirements, then add minimal but sufficient doc comments to satisfy the new lint rules. The author explicitly acknowledged the trade-off - while derive macros aren't the primary place for conceptual documentation, basic docs are still valuable for maintenance and API discovery.

The implementation is concise but effective. First, the `expect(missing_docs)` directive was replaced with a proper module-level doc comment. This establishes context for the entire macros module:
```rust
//! Macros for deriving ECS traits.
```

Next, each derive macro received a clear one-line documentation:
```rust
/// Implement the `Bundle` trait.
#[proc_macro_derive(Bundle, attributes(bundle))]
pub fn derive_bundle(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
```

This pattern was consistently applied to all major derives:
- `MapEntities`
- `Event`
- `Resource`
- `Component`
- `FromWorld`

The documentation follows Rust conventions by using imperative verb phrases ("Implement the X trait") that clearly state each macro's purpose. While brief, these docs significantly improve discoverability and provide just enough context for developers working with these macros.

Technically, this change demonstrates how to incrementally improve documentation coverage in a codebase. By starting with high-level module documentation and basic function descriptions, the PR creates a foundation for more detailed documentation later. The choice to use `deny(missing_docs)` rather than `warn` ensures future contributions will maintain this standard.

The impact is immediate and practical: the macros crate now has 100% documentation coverage, making it easier to navigate and maintain. This also progresses Bevy toward its broader documentation goals without introducing significant maintenance overhead. The minimal documentation approach reflects a pragmatic understanding that derive macros primarily need functional descriptions rather than conceptual explanations.

### Key Files Changed

**File:** `crates/bevy_ecs/macros/src/lib.rs`

1. **Module documentation added**  
   Before:
   ```rust
   #![expect(missing_docs, reason = "Not all docs are written yet, see #3492.")]
   ```
   
   After:
   ```rust
   //! Macros for deriving ECS traits.
   ```

2. **Derive macros documented**  
   Before (representative example):
   ```rust
   #[proc_macro_derive(Bundle, attributes(bundle))]
   pub fn derive_bundle(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
   ```
   
   After:
   ```rust
   /// Implement the `Bundle` trait.
   #[proc_macro_derive(Bundle, attributes(bundle))]
   pub fn derive_bundle(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
   ```

3. **Consistent documentation pattern applied to:**
   - `MapEntities`
   - `Event`
   - `Resource`
   - `Component`
   - `FromWorld`

These changes directly support the PR's objective by satisfying the `deny(missing_docs)` requirement while establishing a baseline of documentation for critical ECS macros.
