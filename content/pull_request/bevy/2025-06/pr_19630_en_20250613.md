### Fix incorrect description of ClusteredDecal

#### Basic Information
- **Title**: Fix incorrect description of ClusteredDecal  
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19630  
- **Author**: chendaohan  
- **Status**: MERGED  
- **Labels**: C-Docs, A-Rendering, S-Ready-For-Final-Review  
- **Created**: 2025-06-13T19:12:07Z  
- **Merged**: 2025-06-13T19:51:54Z  
- **Merged By**: alice-i-cecile  

#### Description Translation  
The documentation states that ClusteredDecal projects in the +Z direction, but in practice, it projects in the -Z direction, which can be confusing.  

# Objective  

Fixes #19612  

#### The Story of This Pull Request  
This PR addresses a documentation discrepancy in Bevy's rendering system. The `ClusteredDecal` component's documentation incorrectly stated that decals project in the +Z direction, while the actual implementation uses -Z for projection. This mismatch could mislead developers when positioning decals in 3D space.  

The issue (#19612) was straightforward: incorrect documentation causing confusion. The solution involved a minimal but precise change to the doc comment. Since Bevy uses a right-handed coordinate system with -Z as the forward direction, the documentation needed alignment with this convention. The `Transform::looking_at` method naturally orients objects toward -Z, making the updated documentation consistent with established engine behavior.  

The implementation was a single-line change in the Rust doc comment. No code logic required modification since the rendering system already correctly used -Z projection. This change ensures developers can reliably use the documented behavior when positioning decals with methods like `looking_at`, which aligns entities' local -Z axis toward targets.  

#### Key Files Changed  
**crates/bevy_pbr/src/decal/clustered.rs**  
- **Change**: Corrected projection direction in doc comment from +Z to -Z  
- **Why**: Aligns documentation with actual rendering behavior and engine conventions  
- **Impact**: Prevents developer confusion when positioning decals
