## Description Translation
# Objective

- Fix #19759 
- The bigger permutation table only comes into play for higher dimensions than 1, when you start doing `PERMUTATION_TABLE[PERMUTATION_TABLE[index] + some_number]`
  - The bigger permutation table has no mathematical meaning, it's just there to avoid having to write more `& 0xFF` when doing multiple nested lookups in higher dimensions
- But we only use 1D Perlin noise for the camera shake because we want the dimensions to be uncorrelated

## Solution

- So, we can trim the permutation table down :) 
  - This should be mathematically identical, as a wrapped value will still access the same element as an unwrapped value would in the bigger table
- The comment was a bit misleading anyways. "mirror" did not refer to "mirrored values" but to "repeated values". 

## Testing

- Ran the example. Still behaves like before.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a specific optimization opportunity in Bevy's 2D screen shake example. The example uses 1D Perlin noise to generate camera shake effects, but contained a 512-element permutation table - twice the size needed for 1D noise generation. This larger table is only beneficial for higher-dimensional noise implementations where it helps avoid repeated bitmask operations.

The core issue was that the 1D implementation only requires a 256-element table since it performs a single lookup per dimension. The second half of the table was unused dead code. The author recognized this when investigating issue #19759, which likely questioned the table size or usage.

The solution involved two key changes: First, the permutation table was reduced from 512 to 256 elements by removing the duplicated second half. Second, the indexing logic was modified to use properly wrapped indices. The new implementation calculates:
```rust
let xi0 = x_floor & 0xFF;
let xi1 = (x_floor + 1) & 0xFF;
```
This wrapping ensures the same results as the previous implementation while using half the memory. The author also corrected the table's documentation comment to clarify it contains a random sequence rather than "mirrored" values.

Testing confirmed identical behavior in the screen shake example. The changes reduce the compiled binary size slightly and make the noise implementation more efficient for its specific 1D use case. For developers, this serves as a good example of right-sizing data structures to actual requirements.

## Key Files Changed

### `examples/camera/2d_screen_shake.rs`

**Changes**: 
- Reduced permutation table size from 512 to 256 elements
- Modified index wrapping logic
- Updated documentation comment

**Code Changes**:
```rust
// Before:
let xi = xi0 & 0xFF;
let h0 = PERMUTATION_TABLE[xi];
let h1 = PERMUTATION_TABLE[xi + 1];

const PERMUTATION_TABLE: [u8; 512] = [
    // ... 512 elements ...
];

// After:
let xi0 = x_floor & 0xFF;
let xi1 = (x_floor + 1) & 0xFF;
let h0 = PERMUTATION_TABLE[xi0];
let h1 = PERMUTATION_TABLE[xi1];

// Perlin noise permutation table. This is a random sequence of the numbers 0-255.
const PERMUTATION_TABLE: [u8; 256] = [
    // ... 256 elements ...
];
```

**Rationale**: 
The changes eliminate unused code while maintaining identical noise output. The new indexing logic explicitly wraps both coordinates using bitwise AND (`& 0xFF`), making the 1D implementation self-contained and efficient.
