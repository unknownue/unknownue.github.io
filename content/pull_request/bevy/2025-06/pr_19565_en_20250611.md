### Description Translation
Link in the "asset settings" example. The struct was moved.

### The Story of This Pull Request

#### The Problem and Context
The `asset_settings.rs` example contained an outdated documentation link for the `ImageLoaderSettings` struct. This occurred because the struct had been moved from `bevy::render::texture` to `bevy::image` in a previous refactor. The outdated link would direct users to incorrect documentation, potentially causing confusion and reducing the effectiveness of the example as a learning resource.

#### The Solution Approach
The solution required updating the documentation URL to reflect the struct's new location. Since this was a straightforward documentation fix with no functional changes, the implementation consisted of a single-line modification in the example file. No alternatives were considered as the change directly addressed the root cause.

#### The Implementation
The implementation modifies the comment containing the documentation link. The old path pointed to `bevy/render/texture/struct.ImageLoaderSettings.html`, while the updated path correctly references `bevy/image/struct.ImageLoaderSettings.html`:

```rust
// Before:
// https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/render/texture/struct.ImageLoaderSettings.html#

// After:
// https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/image/struct.ImageLoaderSettings.html
```

This change ensures developers referencing the example will be directed to the correct documentation for the current API structure.

#### Technical Insights
This change highlights the importance of maintaining accurate documentation links, especially after structural refactors. The `ImageLoaderSettings` struct plays a critical role in texture filtering configuration, particularly for pixel art assets where nearest-neighbor filtering is often preferred. Keeping documentation links current helps developers:
1. Correctly configure texture sampling
2. Understand available filtering options
3. Maintain visual consistency in pixel-art projects

#### The Impact
This PR provides immediate value by:
- Correcting a documentation link that could misdirect users
- Maintaining the example's usefulness as a reference
- Preventing potential confusion about struct location
- Improving the onboarding experience for new contributors

The change has no runtime impact but significantly enhances documentation accuracy. It serves as a reminder to update documentation references when moving types during refactoring.
