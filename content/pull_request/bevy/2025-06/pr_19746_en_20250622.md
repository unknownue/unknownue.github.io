## Description Translation
Fix https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19617 

Add newlines before all impl blocks.

I suspect that at least some of these will be objectionable! If there's a desired Bevy style for this then I'll update the PR. If not then we can just close it - it's the work of a single find and replace.

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
The Bevy codebase had inconsistent formatting around `impl` blocks. Some implementations had preceding newlines while others didn't, creating visual inconsistency throughout the codebase. This inconsistency made code harder to scan and visually parse, particularly in files with multiple consecutive `impl` blocks. The issue was documented in GitHub issue #19617.

While seemingly minor, consistent formatting improves code readability and maintainability. In a large codebase like Bevy with many contributors, consistent style reduces cognitive load and helps developers navigate code more efficiently.

### The Solution Approach
The solution was straightforward: add a newline before every `impl` block throughout the codebase. This approach was chosen because:
1. It creates consistent visual separation between type definitions and their implementations
2. It aligns with common Rust formatting conventions
3. It can be applied systematically without affecting functionality

The author acknowledged that some instances might need adjustment based on Bevy's style preferences, but proposed this as a baseline improvement.

### The Implementation
The implementation used a systematic find-and-replace approach across the entire codebase. Changes were made to 59 files across multiple crates including `bevy_ecs`, `bevy_math`, `bevy_reflect`, and others. Each change inserts a single newline character before an `impl` block.

For example, in `crates/bevy_ecs/src/archetype.rs`:

```rust
// Before:
impl Index<RangeFrom<ArchetypeGeneration>> for Archetypes {
    type Output = [Archetype];
    fn index(&self, index: RangeFrom<ArchetypeGeneration>) -> &Self::Output {
        &self.archetypes[index.start.0.index()..]
    }
}
impl Index<ArchetypeId> for Archetypes {
    type Output = Archetype;
```

```rust
// After:
impl Index<RangeFrom<ArchetypeGeneration>> for Archetypes {
    type Output = [Archetype];
    fn index(&self, index: RangeFrom<ArchetypeGeneration>) -> &Self::Output {
        &self.archetypes[index.start.0.index()..]
    }
}

impl Index<ArchetypeId> for Archetypes {
    type Output = Archetype;
```

The change adds visual separation between the two implementation blocks, making them easier to distinguish.

### Technical Insights
The change is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect:
- Code functionality
- Compilation
- Runtime performance
- API contracts

The consistency improvement helps with:
- Code scanning during reviews
- Navigating large files
- Understanding code structure at a glance

### The Impact
This change:
1. Resolves the original formatting inconsistency issue (#19617)
2. Improves code readability throughout the codebase
3. Establishes a consistent pattern for future contributions
4. Affects 59 files with minimal risk since no logic was modified

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_window/src/event.rs`
Added newlines before 26 `impl` blocks to improve separation of event trait implementations.

```rust
// Example change
impl From<AppLifecycle> for WindowEvent {
    fn from(e: AppLifecycle) -> Self {
        Self::AppLifecycle(e)
    }
}

impl From<CursorEntered> for WindowEvent {
    fn from(e: CursorEntered) -> Self {
        Self::CursorEntered(e)
    }
}
```

### `crates/bevy_math/src/primitives/dim2.rs`
Added newlines before 18 `impl` blocks for 2D primitive types.

```rust
// Example change
impl Primitive2d for Circle {}

impl Default for Circle {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self { radius: 1.0 }
    }
}
```

### `crates/bevy_math/src/primitives/dim3.rs`
Added newlines before 14 `impl` blocks for 3D primitive types.

```rust
// Example change
impl Primitive3d for Sphere {}

impl Default for Sphere {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self { radius: 1.0 }
    }
}
```

### `crates/bevy_reflect/src/tuple.rs`
Added newlines between tuple implementations.

```rust
// Example change
impl_reflect_tuple! {}
impl_reflect_tuple! {0: A}
impl_reflect_tuple! {0: A, 1: B}
```

```rust
// After:
impl_reflect_tuple! {}

impl_reflect_tuple! {0: A}

impl_reflect_tuple! {0: A, 1: B}
```

### `crates/bevy_math/src/primitives/polygon.rs`
Added newlines before 8 `impl` blocks related to polygon operations.

```rust
// Example change
impl SweepLineEvent {
    #[cfg_attr(
        not(feature = "alloc"),
        allow(dead_code, unused_variables)
    ]
    fn new(position: Vec2, edge_index: usize, endpoint: Endpoint) -> Self {
        SweepLineEvent {
            position,
            edge_index,
            endpoint,
        }
    }
}

impl PartialEq for SweepLineEvent {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.position() == other.position()
    }
}
```
