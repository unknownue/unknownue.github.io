## Description Translation
# Objective

Fixes #19403
As described in the issue, the objective is to support the use of systems returning `Result<(), BevyError>` and 
`Result<bool, BevyError>` as run conditions. In these cases, the run condition would hold on `Ok(())` and `Ok(true)` respectively.

## Solution

`IntoSystem<In, bool, M>` cannot be implemented for systems returning `Result<(), BevyError>` and `Result<bool, BevyError>` as that would conflict with their trivial implementation of the trait. That led me to add a method to the sealed trait `SystemCondition` that does the conversion. In the original case of a system returning `bool`, the system is returned as is. With the new types, the system is combined with `map()` to obtain a `bool`.

By the way, I'm confused as to why `SystemCondition` has a generic `In` parameter as it is only ever used with `In = ()` as far as I can tell.

## Testing

I added a simple test for both type of system. That's minimal but it felt enough. I could not picture the more complicated tests passing for a run condition returning `bool` and failing for the new types.

## Doc

I documenting the change on the page of the trait. I had trouble wording it right but I'm not sure how to improve it. The phrasing "the condition returns `true`" which reads naturally is now technically incorrect as the new types return a `Result`. However, the underlying condition system that the implementing system turns into does indeed return `bool`. But talking about the implementation details felt too much. Another possibility is to use another turn of phrase like "the condition holds" or "the condition checks out". I've left "the condition returns `true`" in the documentation of `run_if` and the provided methods for now.

I'm perplexed about the examples. In the first one, why not implement the condition directly instead of having a system returning it? Is it from a time of Bevy where you had to implement your conditions that way? In that case maybe that should be updated. And in the second example I'm missing the point entirely. As I stated above, I've only seen conditions used in contexts where they have no input parameter. Here we create a condition with an input parameter (cannot be used by `run_if`) and we are using it with `pipe()` which actually doesn't need our system to implement `SystemCondition`. Both examples are also calling `IntoSystem::into_system` which should not be encouraged. What am I missing?

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
Bevy's ECS system conditions (`run_if`) only supported systems returning `bool`, which prevented developers from using error-handling patterns with `Result` types in their condition checks. This limitation became apparent in issue #19403, where users needed to express conditions that might fail and return `BevyError`. The existing implementation couldn't accommodate systems returning `Result<(), BevyError>` or `Result<bool, BevyError>` because:

1. Implementing `IntoSystem<In, bool, M>` for these `Result` types would conflict with existing trait implementations
2. The `SystemCondition` trait was tightly coupled to `bool` output
3. There was no mechanism to convert `Result` types to boolean conditions

This forced developers to write error-prone workarounds instead of using Bevy's idiomatic error handling patterns in condition systems.

### The Solution Approach
The core solution extends the `SystemCondition` trait to support multiple output types while maintaining backward compatibility. Instead of modifying the `IntoSystem` implementation (which would cause conflicts), we add a new method to the sealed `SystemCondition` trait that converts different output types to a unified `bool` condition:

1. For existing `bool` systems: Keep the original system unchanged
2. For `Result<(), BevyError>`: Map to `true` on `Ok(())`, `false` on `Err`
3. For `Result<bool, BevyError>`: Map to `true` on `Ok(true)`, `false` otherwise

The implementation uses Rust's trait system to provide specialized handling for each output type while preserving the existing API contracts. The `SystemCondition` trait was generalized with an `Out` type parameter to support these different return types.

### The Implementation
The key change introduces a private `into_condition_system` method in the sealed `SystemCondition` trait that handles the conversion logic:

```rust
// Inside sealed mod
pub trait SystemCondition<Marker, In: SystemInput, Out>:
    IntoSystem<In, Out, Marker, System = Self::ReadOnlySystem>
{
    type ReadOnlySystem: ReadOnlySystem<In = In, Out = Out>;
    fn into_condition_system(self) -> impl ReadOnlySystem<In = In, Out = bool>;
}
```

Three implementations handle the different output types:

1. **Existing bool systems** pass through unchanged:
```rust
impl<Marker, In: SystemInput, F> SystemCondition<Marker, In, bool> for F
where
    F: IntoSystem<In, bool, Marker>,
    F::System: ReadOnlySystem,
{
    fn into_condition_system(self) -> impl ReadOnlySystem<In = In, Out = bool> {
        IntoSystem::into_system(self)
    }
}
```

2. **Result<(), BevyError>** maps to `is_ok()`:
```rust
impl<Marker, In: SystemInput, F> SystemCondition<Marker, In, Result<(), BevyError>> for F
where
    F: IntoSystem<In, Result<(), BevyError>, Marker>,
    F::System: ReadOnlySystem,
{
    fn into_condition_system(self) -> impl ReadOnlySystem<In = In, Out = bool> {
        IntoSystem::into_system(self.map(|result| result.is_ok()))
    }
}
```

3. **Result<bool, BevyError>** checks for `Ok(true)`:
```rust
impl<Marker, In: SystemInput, F> SystemCondition<Marker, In, Result<bool, BevyError>> for F
where
    F: IntoSystem<In, Result<bool, BevyError>, Marker>,
    F::System: ReadOnlySystem,
{
    fn into_condition_system(self) -> impl ReadOnlySystem<In = In, Out = bool> {
        IntoSystem::into_system(self.map(|result| matches!(result, Ok(true))))
    }
}
```

The public API surface was updated to use this new method instead of directly calling `into_system`:

```rust
// Before:
let condition_system = IntoSystem::into_system(condition);

// After:
let condition_system = condition.into_condition_system();
```

### Testing and Documentation
Comprehensive tests verify all three condition types work correctly with Bevy's scheduling system:

```rust
#[test]
fn system_with_condition_result_unit() {
    // Tests Result<(), BevyError> condition
    schedule.add_systems(
        make_function_system(0).run_if(|| Err::<(), BevyError>(core::fmt::Error.into())),
    );
    // Verifies system doesn't run on error
}

#[test]
fn system_with_condition_result_bool() {
    // Tests Result<bool, BevyError> condition
    schedule.add_systems((
        make_function_system(0).run_if(|| Err::<bool, BevyError>(core::fmt::Error.into())),
        make_function_system(1).run_if(|| Ok(false)),
    ));
    // Verifies only system with Ok(true) runs
}
```

Documentation was updated to explain the new behavior while maintaining consistency with existing terminology. The trait documentation now explicitly lists all supported output types and their mapping to boolean conditions.

### Technical Insights
The implementation demonstrates several important patterns in Bevy's ECS:

1. **Trait specialization**: Using multiple trait implementations for different types while maintaining a unified interface
2. **Sealed trait pattern**: Preventing external implementations while extending functionality
3. **System composition**: Leveraging `map()` to transform system outputs without runtime overhead
4. **Backward compatibility**: Maintaining existing behavior for `bool` systems while adding new capabilities

A notable observation is that the `In` type parameter in `SystemCondition` appears unused in practice, as conditions are always invoked with `()` input. This could be simplified in future refactors.
