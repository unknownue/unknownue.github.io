### The Story of This Pull Request  
#### The Problem and Context  
`MeshAllocator` manages GPU buffers for mesh data but lacked flexibility to add custom usage flags to these buffers. This became apparent when downstream changes (like #19058) required buffers to support additional operations (e.g., `BufferUsages::STORAGE`). Without a way to inject extra usage flags, developers couldn't extend buffer capabilities for advanced rendering techniques.  

#### The Solution Approach  
The fix introduces an `extra_buffer_usages` field in `MeshAllocator`. This field allows injecting arbitrary `BufferUsages` flags when creating vertex/index buffers. The implementation ensures backward compatibility by defaulting to empty flags (`BufferUsages::empty()`). The new field is OR'ed with existing usage flags during buffer creation, ensuring minimal disruption to existing logic.  

#### The Implementation  
The `MeshAllocator` struct was extended with `pub extra_buffer_usages: BufferUsages`. This field is initialized as empty in `FromWorld`:  
```rust  
extra_buffer_usages: BufferUsages::empty(),  
```  

During buffer allocation, `extra_buffer_usages` is bitwise-OR'ed with existing flags:  
1. **New slab creation** (initial buffer allocation):  
   ```rust  
   usage: buffer_usages | BufferUsages::COPY_DST | self.extra_buffer_usages,  
   ```  
2. **Existing slab expansion** (resizing buffers):  
   ```rust  
   usage: buffer_usages | self.extra_buffer_usages,  
   ```  

This ensures all buffers inherit the extra flags without altering core allocation logic.  

#### Technical Insights  
- **Bitwise Composition**: Combining flags via `|` ensures additive behavior. For example, `BufferUsages::VERTEX | BufferUsages::STORAGE` enables both vertex binding and compute shader access.  
- **Default Safety**: Initializing `extra_buffer_usages` as empty preserves existing behavior unless explicitly overridden.  
- **WebGL Compatibility**: The change doesn’t affect the `general_vertex_slabs_supported` workaround for WebGL2, maintaining platform-specific constraints.  

#### The Impact  
- **Extensibility**: Downstream code can now configure buffers for advanced use cases (e.g., GPU-driven rendering via storage access).  
- **Zero Overhead**: Unused extra flags incur no performance cost.  
- **Non-breaking**: Default behavior remains unchanged, making this backward-compatible.

### Key Files Changed  
#### `crates/bevy_render/src/mesh/allocator.rs`  
**Changes**:  
1. Added `extra_buffer_usages` field to `MeshAllocator`.  
2. Integrated the field into buffer creation logic.  

**Code Snippets**:  
```rust  
// Before:  
pub struct MeshAllocator {  
    general_vertex_slabs_supported: bool,  
}  

// After:  
pub struct MeshAllocator {  
    general_vertex_slabs_supported: bool,  
    pub extra_buffer_usages: BufferUsages,  
}  
```  

```rust  
// Before:  
usage: buffer_usages | BufferUsages::COPY_DST,  

// After:  
usage: buffer_usages | BufferUsages::COPY_DST | self.extra_buffer_usages,  
```  

```rust  
// Before:  
usage: buffer_usages,  

// After:  
usage: buffer_usages | self.extra_buffer_usages,  
```  

**Relation to PR Purpose**:  
These changes enable flexible buffer usage configuration while maintaining existing allocation semantics.
