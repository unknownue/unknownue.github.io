### The Story of This Pull Request

**Problem and Context**  
When configuring cameras in Bevy's rendering system, developers need to set texture usage flags for the camera's main texture. These flags (`TextureUsages`) control how the texture can be used (e.g., as a render target, sampler, or storage buffer). Previously, modifying these flags required manual bitwise operations or recreating the entire `CameraMainTextureUsages` struct. This was cumbersome and error-prone, especially when adding additional usage flags to existing configurations.

**Solution Approach**  
The author implemented a builder pattern helper method that allows chaining additional texture usages to an existing `CameraMainTextureUsages` configuration. This approach:
1. Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
2. Provides a type-safe way to combine texture usage flags
3. Avoids introducing breaking changes to the API

The solution uses Rust's bitwise OR assignment operator (`|=`) to combine usage flags efficiently. This approach was chosen over alternatives like constructor overloads because it preserves the default usage configuration while allowing incremental modifications.

**Implementation**  
The core change adds a `with()` method to the `CameraMainTextureUsages` struct. The method takes `mut self` to enable method chaining and consumes a `TextureUsages` parameter. Internally, it performs a bitwise OR operation between the existing flags and new flags:

```rust
impl CameraMainTextureUsages {
    pub fn with(mut self, usages: TextureUsages) -> Self {
        self.0 |= usages;
        self
    }
}
```

This implementation is efficient because:
1. It operates on the underlying `u32` representation of `TextureUsages`
2. It uses Rust's move semantics to avoid unnecessary copies
3. The bitwise OR operation compiles to a single CPU instruction

**Technical Insights**  
The `TextureUsages` type is a bitflag enum where different usage scenarios can be combined using bitwise operations. The new helper method leverages this characteristic by providing a safe abstraction over the bitwise OR operation. This pattern is consistent with other builder-style APIs in Bevy's codebase.

The method signature `with(mut self, ...) -> Self` enables fluent interface usage:
```rust
let usage = CameraMainTextureUsages::default()
    .with(TextureUsages::RENDER_ATTACHMENT)
    .with(TextureUsages::TEXTURE_BINDING);
```

**Impact**  
This change improves code readability and reduces boilerplate when configuring cameras. Developers can now clearly express additive modifications to texture usage flags without manually managing bitwise operations. The change is fully backward compatible and doesn't affect existing uses of `CameraMainTextureUsages`.

### Key Files Changed
**File**: `crates/bevy_render/src/camera/camera.rs`  
Added helper method to enable builder pattern usage of `CameraMainTextureUsages`.

```rust
// Before:
impl CameraMainTextureUsages {
    // No helper methods existed
}

// After:
impl CameraMainTextureUsages {
    pub fn with(mut self, usages: TextureUsages) -> Self {
        self.0 |= usages;
        self
    }
}
```
