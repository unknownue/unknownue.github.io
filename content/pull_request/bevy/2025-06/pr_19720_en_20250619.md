### Analysis of PR #19720: Remove `'s` lifetime from `WorldQuery::Fetch`

#### Basic Information
- **Title**: Remove `'s` lifetime from `WorldQuery::Fetch`
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19720
- **Author**: chescock
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Labels**: A-ECS, S-Ready-For-Final-Review
- **Created**: 2025-06-18T17:45:46Z
- **Merged**: 2025-06-19T01:18:16Z
- **Merged By**: alice-i-cecile

#### Description Translation
# Objective  
Unblock #18162.  

#15396 added the `'s` lifetime to `QueryData::Item` to make it possible for query items to borrow from the state. The state isn't passed directly to `QueryData::fetch()`, so it also added the `'s` lifetime to `WorldQuery::Fetch` to pass borrows through.  

Unfortunately, having `WorldQuery::Fetch` borrow from the state made it impossible to have owned state, because we store the state and the `Fetch` in the same `struct` during iteration.  

## Solution  
Undo the change adding the `'s` lifetime to `WorldQuery::Fetch`.  

Instead, add a `&'s Self::State` parameter to `QueryData::fetch()` and `QueryFilter::filter_fetch()` so borrows from the state can be passed directly to query items.

#### The Story of This Pull Request

**The Problem and Context**  
PR #15396 introduced the `'s` lifetime to `WorldQuery::Fetch` to enable query items to borrow from query state. This allowed state-dependent borrows in queries but created a fundamental limitation: since the query state and its associated `Fetch` are stored together during iteration, the `Fetch` couldn't borrow from the state it was contained within. This made owned state in queries impossible, blocking features like those planned in #18162.

**The Solution Approach**  
The core issue was resolved by removing the `'s` lifetime from `WorldQuery::Fetch`. Instead, state borrows are now passed explicitly via a new `&'s Self::State` parameter in:
1. `QueryData::fetch()`
2. `QueryFilter::filter_fetch()`  

This decouples the fetch's lifetime from the state, allowing owned state while preserving state borrows in query items. The implementation required coordinated changes across:
- `WorldQuery` trait definitions
- Query initialization logic
- All existing `WorldQuery` implementations

**The Implementation**  
Key changes include:
1. **Removed `'s` from `WorldQuery::Fetch`:**
   ```rust
   // Before:
   type Fetch<'w, 's>;
   // After:
   type Fetch<'w>;
   ```
   
2. **Added state parameter to fetch methods:**
   ```rust
   // QueryData::fetch signature
   unsafe fn fetch<'w, 's>(
       state: &'s Self::State,      // New parameter
       fetch: &mut Self::Fetch<'w>,  // No 's lifetime
       entity: Entity,
       table_row: TableRow,
   ) -> Self::Item<'w, 's>;
   ```

3. **Updated query iteration logic** to pass state to fetch calls:
   ```rust
   // In query iterators:
   let item = D::fetch(
       &self.query_state.fetch_state, // Pass state explicitly
       &mut self.cursor.fetch,
       entity,
       table_row,
   );
   ```

**Technical Insights**  
- **Lifetime Decoupling**: By removing `'s` from `Fetch`, the state and fetch can now coexist in the same struct without lifetime conflicts. The state is passed as a separate reference during fetch operations.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `WorldQuery` implementations required updates to fetch signatures and initialization logic. The macros generating query types were adjusted to handle the new state parameter.
- **Performance**: No significant performance impact is expected since the state reference is passed by value and the changes are primarily structural.

**The Impact**  
- **Unblocks #18162**: Enables owned state in queries, a key requirement for advanced ECS features.
- **Simplifies Query Internals**: Reduces lifetime complexity in query system internals.
- **Codebase-Wide Changes**: Affects all query-related code, including derived queries via macros.

#### Key Files Changed

1. **`crates/bevy_ecs/src/query/fetch.rs`**  
   - Updated `WorldQuery` and `QueryData` trait definitions to remove `'s` from `Fetch` and add state parameter to `fetch()`.
   - Modified all `WorldQuery` implementations to match new signatures.  
   **Example Change:**  
   ```rust
   // Before:
   unsafe impl WorldQuery for Entity {
       type Fetch<'w, 's> = ();
       unsafe fn fetch<'w, 's>(fetch: &mut Self::Fetch, ...) -> ... { ... }
   }
   
   // After:
   unsafe impl WorldQuery for Entity {
       type Fetch<'w> = ();
       unsafe fn fetch<'w, 's>(_state: &'s State, _fetch: &mut Self::Fetch, ...) -> ... { ... }
   }
   ```

2. **`crates/bevy_ecs/src/query/filter.rs`**  
   - Added state parameter to `QueryFilter::filter_fetch()`.  
   **Example Change:**  
   ```rust
   // Before:
   unsafe fn filter_fetch(fetch: &mut Self::Fetch, ...) -> bool;
   
   // After:
   unsafe fn filter_fetch(state: &Self::State, fetch: &mut Self::Fetch, ...) -> bool;
   ```

3. **`crates/bevy_ecs/src/query/iter.rs`**  
   - Updated query iteration logic to pass state to fetch methods.  
   **Example Change:**  
   ```rust
   // In iteration logic:
   let item = D::fetch(
       &query_state.fetch_state, // State added here
       &mut cursor.fetch,
       entity,
       table_row,
   );
   ```

4. **`crates/bevy_ecs/macros/src/query_data.rs`**  
   - Adjusted query-derive macros to handle new state parameter.  
   **Example Change:**  
   ```rust
   // Macro-generated fetch call:
   unsafe fn fetch(...) -> ... {
       Self::Item {
           field: <FieldType>::fetch(&state.field, &mut fetch.field, ...)
       }
   }
   ```

5. **`crates/bevy_render/src/sync_world.rs`**  
   - Updated render-specific `WorldQuery` implementations to match new signatures.  
   **Example Change:**  
   ```rust
   // Before:
   unsafe fn fetch(fetch: &mut Self::Fetch, ...) -> ...;
   
   // After:
   unsafe fn fetch(state: &Self::State, fetch: &mut Self::Fetch, ...) -> ...;
   ```
