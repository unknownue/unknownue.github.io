## Technical Report: Thoroughly Documenting Bevy Observers  

### Basic Information  
- **Title**: Thoroughly document the current state of observers  
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19590  
- **Author**: alice-i-cecile  
- **Status**: MERGED  
- **Labels**: C-Docs, A-ECS, S-Ready-For-Final-Review, X-Uncontroversial, D-Modest  
- **Created**: 2025-06-11T20:43:14Z

- **Merged By**: alice-i-cecile  

### Description Translation  
# Objective  

The documentation for observers is not very good. This poses a problem to users, but *also* causes serious problems for engine devs, as they attempt to improve assorted issues surrounding observers.  

This PR:  

- Fixes #14084.  
- Fixes #14726.  
- Fixes #16538.  
- Closes #18914, by attempting to solve the same issue.  

To keep this PR at all reviewable, I've opted to simply note the various limitations (some may call them bugs!) in place, rather than attempting to fix them. There is a huge amount of cleanup work to be done here: see https://github.com/orgs/bevyengine/projects/17.  

## Solution  

- Write good module docs for observers, offering bread crumbs to the most common methods and techniques and comparing-and-contrasting as needed.  
- Fix any actively misleading documentation.  
- Try to explain how the various bits of the (public?!) internals are related.  

### The Problem and Context  
Observers in Bevy's ECS provided push-based event handling but suffered from inadequate documentation. This caused multiple issues:  
1. Users struggled to understand observer targeting (global vs entity-specific)  
2. Engine developers faced obstacles improving observer-related systems  
3. Key limitations like observer retargeting constraints weren't documented  
4. Misleading comments created incorrect mental models of observer behavior  

The documentation gaps directly impacted four open issues (#14084, #14726, #16538, #18914) and hindered ongoing work in the observer system.  

### The Solution Approach  
Instead of implementing behavioral changes, this PR focuses exclusively on documentation improvements:  
1. Comprehensive module-level docs explaining core concepts  
2. Targeted fixes to misleading comments in critical structs  
3. Explicit documentation of current limitations and workarounds  
4. Clear comparisons between observers and buffered events (EventReader/Writer)  

Key engineering decisions:  
- Preserved existing behavior while clarifying functionality  
- Documented known issues instead of attempting fixes in this PR  
- Structured documentation for both users and engine developers  
- Added cross-references to related systems like lifecycle events  

### Implementation Details  
The implementation consists entirely of documentation improvements to `observer/mod.rs`:  

**Module Documentation**  
Added comprehensive module-level docs covering:  
- Observer targeting and spawning patterns  
- Event propagation mechanics  
- Timing characteristics relative to schedules  
- Comparison with buffered event systems  
- Lifecycle event interactions  

```rust
//! Observers are a push-based tool for responding to [`Event`]s.
//!
//! ## Observer targeting
//!
//! Observers can be "global"... [detailed explanation continues]
```

**Struct Documentation**  
Enhanced docs for critical structs including:  
1. `Trigger` - Clarified generic `B` parameter behavior and target semantics  
2. `TriggerTargets` - Explained collection semantics  
3. `ObserverDescriptor` - Added component relationship context  
4. Internal caching structs - Documented their roles in observer lookup  

```rust
/// The generic `B: Bundle` is used to modify the further specialize...
/// Providing multiple components... [rather than requiring all of them](
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15325).
pub struct Trigger<'w, E, B: Bundle = ()> { ... }
```

**Behavioral Caveats**  
Explicitly documented current limitations:  
```rust
//! Currently, [observers cannot be retargeted after spawning](
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19587)
//! Currently, Bevy does not provide [a way to specify the ordering of observers](
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14890)
//! Commands sent by observers are [currently not immediately applied](
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19569)
```

### Technical Insights  
Key technical clarifications provided:  

**Observer Targeting**  
- Explained difference between global and entity-specific observation  
- Documented `ObservedBy` component relationship  
- Clarified component-based targeting via generic `B` bundle  

**Lifecycle Events**  
- Detailed hook vs observer execution order:  
  - Component addition: hooks → observers  
  - Component removal: observers → hooks  
- Explained rationale for ordering (constructors/destructors)  

**Performance Characteristics**  
- Compared observers (push-based) vs buffered events (pull-based):  
  - Observers better for rare events  
  - Buffered events better for high-frequency events  
- Documented command application timing constraints  

**Architectural Notes**  
- Explained relationship between:  
  - `Observer` component and observer entities  
  - `CachedObservers` and world storage  
  - `TriggerTargets` and event propagation  

### Impact  
1. Resolved four documentation-related issues  
2. Provided clear usage guidance for common patterns  
3. Documented 8 current limitations with issue links  
4. Established foundation for future observer improvements  
5. Clarified internal structures for engine developers  

### Key Files Changed  

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/observer/mod.rs** (+167/-18)  
Complete overhaul of module documentation and struct comments.  

Key additions:  
```rust
// Before: minimal module docs
//! Types for creating and storing [`Observer`]s

// After: comprehensive usage guide
//! Observers are a push-based tool for responding to [`Event`]s.
//!
//! ## Observer targeting
//! [Detailed sections covering 10+ aspects of observer usage]...
```

```rust
// Before: minimal struct docs
/// Type containing triggered event information...

// After: technical precision
/// The generic `B: Bundle` is used to modify...
/// Providing multiple components... [rather than requiring all](
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15325).
pub struct Trigger<'w, E, B: Bundle = ()> { ... }
```

-//! Types for creating and storing [`Observer`]s
+//! Observers are a push-based tool for responding to [`Event`]s.
+//!
+//! ## Observer targeting
+//!
+//! Observers can be "global", listening for events that are both targeted at and not targeted at any specific entity,
+//! or they can be "entity-specific", listening for events that are targeted at specific entities.
+//!
+//! They can also be further refined by listening to events targeted at specific components
+//! (instead of using a generic event type), as is done with the [`OnAdd`] family of lifecycle events.
+//!
+//! When entities are observed, they will receive an [`ObservedBy`] component,
+//! which will be updated to track the observers that are currently observing them.
+//!
+//! Currently, [observers cannot be retargeted after spawning](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19587):
+//! despawn and respawn an observer as a workaround.
+//!
+//! ## Writing observers
+//!
+//! Observers are systems which implement [`IntoObserverSystem`] that listen for [`Event`]s matching their
+//! type and target(s).
+//! To write observer systems, use the [`Trigger`] system parameter as the first parameter of your system.
+//! This parameter provides access to the specific event that triggered the observer,
+//! as well as the entity that the event was targeted at, if any.
+//!
+//! Observers can request other data from the world,
+//! such as via a [`Query`] or [`Res`]. Commonly, you might want to verify that
+//! the entity that the observable event is targeting has a specific component,
+//! or meets some other condition.
+//! [`Query::get`] or [`Query::contains`] on the [`Trigger::target`] entity
+//! is a good way to do this.
+//!
+//! [`Commands`] can also be used inside of observers.
+//! This can be particularly useful for triggering other observers!
+//!
+//! ## Spawning observers
+//!
+//! Observers can be spawned via [`World::add_observer`], or the equivalent app method.
+//! This will cause an entity with the [`Observer`] component to be created,
+//! which will then run the observer system whenever the event it is watching is triggered.
+//!
+//! You can control the targets that an observer is watching by calling [`Observer::watch_entity`]
+//! once the entity is spawned, or by manually spawning an entity with the [`Observer`] component
+//! configured with the desired targets.
+//!
+//! Observers are fundamentally defined as "entities which have the [`Observer`] component"
+//! allowing you to add it manually to existing entities.
+//! At first, this seems convenient, but only one observer can be added to an entity at a time,
+//! regardless of the event it responds to: like always, components are unique.
+//!
+//! Instead, a better way to achieve a similar aim is to
+//! use the [`EntityWorldMut::observe`] / [`EntityCommands::observe`] method,
+//! which spawns a new observer, and configures it to watch the entity it is called on.
+//! Unfortunately, observers defined in this way
+//! [currently cannot be spawned as part of bundles](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14204).
+//!
+//! ## Triggering observers
+//!
+//! Observers are most commonly triggered by [`Commands`],
+//! via [`Commands::trigger`] (for untargeted events) or [`Commands::trigger_targets`] (for targeted events).
+//! Like usual, equivalent methods are available on [`World`], allowing you to reduce overhead when working with exclusive world access.
+//!
+//! If your observer is configured to watch for a specific component or set of components instead,
+//! you can pass in [`ComponentId`]s into [`Commands::trigger_targets`] by using the [`TriggerTargets`] trait.
+//! As discussed in the [`Trigger`] documentation, this use case is rare, and is currently only used
+//! for [lifecycle](crate::lifecycle) events, which are automatically emitted.
+//!
+//! ## Observer bubbling
+//!
+//! When events are targeted at an entity, they can optionally bubble to other targets,
+//! typically up to parents in an entity hierarchy.
+//!
+//! This behavior is controlled via [`Event::Traversal`] and [`Event::AUTO_PROPAGATE`],
+//! with the details of the propagation path specified by the [`Traversal`](crate::traversal::Traversal) trait.
+//!
+//! When auto-propagation is enabled, propagaion must be manually stopped to prevent the event from
+//! continuing to other targets.
+//! This can be done using the [`Trigger::propagate`] method on the [`Trigger`] system parameter inside of your observer.
+//!
+//!  ## Observer timing
+//!
+//! Observers are triggered via [`Commands`], which imply that they are evaluated at the next sync point in the ECS schedule.
+//! Accordingly, they have full access to the world, and are evaluated sequentially, in the order that the commands were sent.
+//!
+//! To control the relative ordering of observers sent from different systems,
+//! order the systems in the schedule relative to each other.
+//!
+//! Currently, Bevy does not provide [a way to specify the ordering of observers](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14890)
+//! listening to the same event relative to each other.
+//!
+//! Commands sent by observers are [currently not immediately applied](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19569).
+//! Instead, all queued observers will run, and then all of the commands from those observers will be applied.
+//! Careful use of [`Schedule::apply_deferred`] may help as a workaround.
+//!
+//! ## Lifecycle events and observers
+//!
+//! It is important to note that observers, just like [hooks](crate::lifecycle::ComponentHooks),
+//! can listen to and respond to [lifecycle](crate::lifecycle) events.
+//! Unlike hooks, observers are not treated as an "innate" part of component behavior:
+//! they can be added or removed at runtime, and multiple observers
+//! can be registered for the same lifecycle event for the same component.
+//!
+//! The ordering of hooks versus observers differs based on the lifecycle event in question:
+//!
+//! - when adding components, hooks are evaluated first, then observers
+//! - when removing components, observers are evaluated first, then hooks
+//!
+//! This allows hooks to act as constructors and destructors for components,
+//! as they always have the first and final say in the component's lifecycle.
+//!
+//! ## Cleaning up observers
+//!
+//! Currently, observer entities are never cleaned up, even if their target entity(s) are despawned.
+//! This won't cause any runtime overhead, but is a waste of memory and can result in memory leaks.
+//!
+//! If you run into this problem, you could manually scan the world for observer entities and despawn them,
+//! by checking if the entity in [`Observer::descriptor`] still exists.
+//!
+//! ## Observers vs buffered events
+//!
+//! By contrast, [`EventReader`] and [`EventWriter`] ("buffered events"), are pull-based.
+//! They require periodically polling the world to check for new events, typically in a system that runs as part of a schedule.
+//!
+//! This imposes a small overhead, making observers a better choice for extremely rare events,
+//! but buffered events can be more efficient for events that are expected to occur multiple times per frame,
+//! as it allows for batch processing of events.
+//!
+//! The difference in timing is also an important consideration:
+//! buffered events are evaluated at fixed points during schedules,
+//! while observers are evaluated as soon as possible after the event is triggered.
+//!
+//! This provides more control over the timing of buffered event evaluation,
+//! but allows for a more ad hoc approach with observers,
+//! and enables indefinite chaining of observers triggering other observers (for both better and worse!).
