+title: Removed `cosmic_text` re-exports
+pull_requests: [TODO]
+---
+
+Previously, `bevy_text` re-exported the entirety of `cosmic_text` while renaming a few of the most confusing re-exports,
+using the following code.
+
+```rust
+pub use cosmic_text::{
+    self, FamilyOwned as FontFamily, Stretch as FontStretch, Style as FontStyle, Weight as FontWeight,
+};
+```
+
+These re-exports commonly conflicted with other types (like `Query`!), leading to messy autocomplete errors.
+Ultimately, these are largely an implementation detail, and were not widely used.
+
+We've completely removed these re-exports (including the renamed types): if you need to use these types, please rely on them directly from `cosmic_text`, being sure that the version number you are using matches the version used by your version of `bevy_text`.
