 It is well documented that both the bit format, serialization, and `Ord` implementations for `Entity` are subject to change between versions.
 Those have all changed in this version.
 
-For entity ordering, the order still prioretizes an entity's generation, but after that, it now considers higher index entities less than lower index entities.

 Option B) Instead of giving special meaning to an entity id, simply use `spawn_batch` and ensure entity references are valid when despawning.
