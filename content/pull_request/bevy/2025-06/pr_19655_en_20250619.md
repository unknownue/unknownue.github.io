### Description Translation
# Objective

Write some more boilerplate-y docs, to get one crate closer to closing https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3492.

### The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses an ongoing documentation gap in the Bevy engine's windowing system. The project maintains issue #3492 to track progress toward fully documenting all public APIs. The `bevy_window` crate previously had incomplete documentation for its `WindowEvent` enum variants, which was temporarily suppressed using `#[expect(missing_docs)]` with a reference to the tracking issue.

The author recognized this as low-hanging fruit in the documentation effort. Since the `WindowEvent` variants represent well-understood window system concepts, writing their documentation requires minimal technical investigation but provides immediate value. The approach was straightforward: systematically add doc comments to each variant in the enum declaration.

By removing the `#[expect(missing_docs)]` attribute after adding documentation, this PR enables Rust's `missing_docs` lint for the `WindowEvent` type. This creates a compile-time guardrail that prevents future undocumented additions to this critical event enumeration. The changes are localized to a single file with no functional modifications, making this a low-risk documentation improvement.

The implementation consists entirely of adding doc comments above each enum variant. Each comment concisely describes the purpose and trigger conditions of the corresponding window event. For example:

```rust
/// The user's cursor has entered a window.
CursorEntered(CursorEntered),
```

Special attention was given to the `KeyboardFocusLost` variant where a slightly longer explanation was warranted:

```rust
/// Sent when focus has been lost for all Bevy windows.
///
/// Used to clear pressed key state.
KeyboardFocusLost(KeyboardFocusLost),
```

These documentation additions make the window event system more approachable for new contributors and eliminate the need for developers to consult external documentation or source code to understand what each event represents. By completing this documentation block, the PR moves the project closer to resolving the overarching documentation issue (#3492) and enables stricter linting for future contributions to this module.

### Key Files Changed

**File**: `crates/bevy_window/src/event.rs`  
**Changes**: Added documentation comments to all variants of the `WindowEvent` enum and removed the `expect` attribute for missing docs.

**Before**:
```rust
#[expect(missing_docs, reason = "Not all docs are written yet, see #3492.")]
pub enum WindowEvent {
    AppLifecycle(AppLifecycle),
    CursorEntered(CursorEntered),
    // ... other variants without documentation ...
}
```

**After**:
```rust
pub enum WindowEvent {
    /// An application lifecycle event.
    AppLifecycle(AppLifecycle),
    /// The user's cursor has entered a window.
    CursorEntered(CursorEntered),
    ///The user's cursor has left a window.
    CursorLeft(CursorLeft),
    /// The user's cursor has moved inside a window.
    CursorMoved(CursorMoved),
    // ... all other variants now have documentation ...
}
```
