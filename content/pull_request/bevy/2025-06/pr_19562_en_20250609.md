# Objective

Fix new typos found on new version of `typos` (#19551)

## Solution

Fix typos

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses minor but important corrections identified by an updated version of the `typos` tool (#19551). The changes are strictly limited to fixing spelling errors in documentation and comments - no functional code modifications are made. 

The core issue was straightforward: recent improvements to the `typos` tool revealed previously undetected misspellings in the codebase. These typos occurred in critical documentation files (migration guides) and code comments where clarity is essential for developer understanding.

The solution approach was systematic:
1. Run the updated `typos` tool across the codebase
2. Identify all flagged spelling errors
3. Verify each instance was indeed an error
4. Make targeted corrections while preserving all technical meaning

All changes were simple substitutions where a misspelled word was replaced with its correct spelling. The corrections maintain:
- Technical accuracy in documentation
- Consistency with surrounding content
- Original formatting and code structure

These changes improve codebase hygiene by:
1. Enhancing documentation clarity for users reading migration guides
2. Maintaining professionalism in code comments
3. Preventing potential confusion from misspelled technical terms
4. Keeping the codebase clean for future linting checks

The quick merge (36 minutes from creation) indicates these were non-controversial, quality-of-life improvements with no technical trade-offs or alternatives considered.

### Key Files Changed

#### 1. `crates/bevy_ecs/src/component.rs`
**Change**: Fixed misspelling in code comment  
**Context**: The comment explains when `Components::get_info` returns `None`  
**Correction**: "regiserted" → "registered"  
```diff
 /// Gets the metadata associated with the given component, if it is registered.
-/// This will return `None` if the id is not regiserted or is queued.
+/// This will return `None` if the id is not registered or is queued.
```

#### 2. `release-content/migration-guides/entity_representation.md`
**Change**: Fixed misspelling in migration guide  
**Context**: Explains entity ordering behavior changes  
**Correction**: "prioretizes" → "prioritizes"  
```diff
-For entity ordering, the order still prioretizes an entity's generation, but after that, it now considers higher index entities less than lower index entities.
+For entity ordering, the order still prioritizes an entity's generation, but after that, it now considers higher index entities less than lower index entities.
```

#### 3. `release-content/migration-guides/remove_deprecated_batch_spawning.md`
**Change**: Fixed misspelling in migration guide  
**Context**: Describes alternative to deprecated batch spawning  
**Correction**: "despawing" → "despawning"  
```diff
-Option A) Instead of despawing entities, insert the `Disabled` component, and instead of respawning them at particular ids, use `try_insert_batch` or `insert_batch` and remove `Disabled`.
+Option A) Instead of despawning entities, insert the `Disabled` component, and instead of respawning them at particular ids, use `try_insert_batch` or `insert_batch` and remove `Disabled`.

 It is well documented that both the bit format, serialization, and `Ord` implementations for `Entity` are subject to change between versions.
 Those have all changed in this version.

 The changes to serialization and the bit format are directly related.
 Effectively, this means that all serialized and transmuted entities will not work as expected and may crash.
