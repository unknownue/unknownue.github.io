## Description Translation
# Objective

Reduce memory usage by storing fewer copies of `FilteredAccessSet<ComponentId>`.  

Currently, the `System` trait exposes the `component_access_set` for the system, which is used by the multi-threaded executor to determine which systems can run concurrently.  But because it is available on the trait, it needs to be stored for *every* system, even ones that are not run by the executor!  In particular, it is never needed for observers, or for the inner systems in a `PipeSystem` or `CombinatorSystem`.  

## Solution

Instead of exposing the access from a method on `System`, return it from `System::initialize`.  Since it is still needed during scheduling, store the access alongside the boxed system in the schedule.  

That's not quite enough for systems built using `SystemParamBuilder`s, though.  Those calculate the access in `SystemParamBuilder::build`, which happens earlier than `System::initialize`.  To handle those, we separate `SystemParam::init_state` into `init_state`, which creates the state value, and `init_access`, which calculates the access.  This lets `System::initialize` call `init_access` on a state that was provided by the builder.  

An additional benefit of that separation is that it removes the need to duplicate access checks between `SystemParamBuilder::build` and `SystemParam::init_state`.  

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
Bevy's ECS stores component access information for each system to determine safe parallel execution. However, this access data was stored directly on every system via the `System::component_access_set()` method, including systems that never run in a schedule (like inner systems of combinators or observers). This resulted in unnecessary memory usage for systems that don't require scheduling.

### The Solution Approach
The solution involves:
1. Removing `component_access_set()` from the `System` trait
2. Having `System::initialize()` return the access set instead
3. Storing the access set alongside systems in schedules
4. Splitting `SystemParam::init_state()` into separate state initialization and access calculation steps

This approach ensures access sets are only stored where needed while maintaining the scheduler's ability to check for conflicts. For systems built with `SystemParamBuilder`, the access calculation is deferred to `System::initialize` by separating state creation (in `build()`) from access registration (in `init_access()`).

### The Implementation
Key changes include:

**1. System trait changes (`system.rs`):**
```rust
pub trait System: Send + Sync + 'static {
    // ...
    fn initialize(&mut self, _world: &mut World) -> FilteredAccessSet<ComponentId>;
    // ... (removed component_access_set())
}
```

**2. New storage structures (`schedule.rs`):**
```rust
pub struct SystemWithAccess {
    pub system: ScheduleSystem,
    pub access: FilteredAccessSet<ComponentId>,
}

pub struct ConditionWithAccess {
    pub condition: BoxedCondition,
    pub access: FilteredAccessSet<ComponentId>,
}
```

**3. SystemParam trait refactor (`system_param.rs`):**
```rust
pub unsafe trait SystemParam: Sized {
    // ...
    fn init_state(world: &mut World) -> Self::State;
    fn init_access(
        state: &Self::State,
        system_meta: &mut SystemMeta,
        component_access_set: &mut FilteredAccessSet<ComponentId>,
        world: &mut World,
    );
    // ... (removed old init_state)
}
```

**4. Executor updates (`executor/multi_threaded.rs`):**
```rust
// Before:
if !system2.component_access_set().is_compatible(system1.component_access_set())

// After:
if !system2.access.is_compatible(&system1.access)
```

### Technical Insights
- **Memory Optimization**: By only storing access sets for scheduled systems, we avoid ~40 bytes per non-scheduled system
- **Architectural Improvement**: Separates state initialization from access calculation
- **Safety Maintained**: All access conflicts are still checked during scheduling
- **Compatibility**: Maintains existing scheduler behavior while optimizing storage

### The Impact
- Reduces memory usage for systems not directly scheduled
- Simplifies system initialization flow
- Maintains scheduler safety guarantees
- Requires adjustments to custom system implementations
