## Description Translation
# Objective

- CI job checking for wasm atomics fails because of an unrelated lint on nightly rust
- Fixes #19573 

## Solution

- Don't deny warning, that's not what this job is checking anyway

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
The Bevy CI pipeline includes a specialized job to validate WebAssembly atomics support. This job uses Rust's nightly compiler with specific flags to check compilation against the wasm32-unknown-unknown target. The configuration included `-D warnings` in RUSTFLAGS, which treats all compiler warnings as errors. This strict setting caused the job to fail when new warnings appeared in the nightly Rust compiler, even though these warnings were unrelated to the actual purpose of the job (verifying wasm atomics support). 

This problem surfaced in issue #19573, where the CI job started failing due to a new warning introduced in a nightly Rust build. The core issue was that the job's configuration was overly strict for its intended purpose. Failing on unrelated warnings created maintenance overhead and false positives in the CI pipeline.

### The Solution Approach
The solution focused on aligning the job's configuration with its actual purpose. Since the job's primary function is to validate wasm atomics compatibility - not to enforce a warning-free codebase - the `-D warnings` flag was removed from the RUSTFLAGS environment variable. This approach maintains the essential atomics validation while eliminating false failures from unrelated lints.

This decision considered several factors:
1. The wasm-atomics job runs on nightly Rust, which frequently introduces new lints
2. Fixing new warnings would create ongoing maintenance work unrelated to wasm support
3. The main CI pipeline already enforces warning-free builds on stable Rust

### The Implementation
The implementation involved a single-line change in the CI configuration file. The modification removed `-D warnings` from the RUSTFLAGS environment variable while preserving the critical atomics-related flags.

#### Before:
```yaml
env:
  RUSTFLAGS: "-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory -D warnings"
```

#### After:
```yaml
env:
  RUSTFLAGS: "-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory"
```

This change maintains the essential `-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory` flags that enable the wasm atomics verification while removing the unrelated lint enforcement.

### Technical Insights
The key technical consideration was understanding the purpose of each flag:
- `-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory`: Essential for enabling WebAssembly thread support and shared memory features
- `-D warnings`: Global flag that treats warnings as errors, useful for main builds but counterproductive for specialized jobs

By removing only the warning-denial flag, the solution:
- Preserves the critical atomics validation functionality
- Reduces CI maintenance burden
- Avoids false positives from nightly compiler changes
- Maintains the existing workflow structure

### The Impact
This change immediately stabilized the wasm-atomics CI job by preventing failures from unrelated warnings. The impact includes:
- Reduced false positives in CI failures
- Lower maintenance overhead for Bevy maintainers
- More reliable signal for actual wasm atomics issues
- Preservation of the important wasm validation functionality

The solution demonstrates good CI pipeline design by ensuring each job focuses on a single responsibility and avoids unnecessary constraints that create maintenance overhead.

## Key Files Changed

### .github/workflows/ci.yml
**What changed**: Removed `-D warnings` from RUSTFLAGS in wasm-atomics job  
**Why changed**: To prevent job failures from unrelated nightly compiler warnings  

```yaml
# Before:
      - name: Check wasm
        run: cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -Z build-std=std,panic_abort
        env:
          RUSTFLAGS: "-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory -D warnings"

# After:
      - name: Check wasm
        run: cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -Z build-std=std,panic_abort
        env:
          RUSTFLAGS: "-C target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory"
```
