## The Story of This Pull Request

This dependency update PR addresses a specific compatibility issue in Bevy's CI pipeline. The core problem was that the existing version of cargo-binstall (1.12.3) contained a bug in its glibc detection logic that would cause failures on Ubuntu 24.02 systems. Since GitHub's CI runners periodically update their underlying OS images, this created a risk of CI failures as Ubuntu 24.02 becomes more prevalent.

The solution approach was straightforward: upgrade to cargo-binstall version 1.12.5 which includes the necessary fix. The upgrade path was clear since the dependency had already been pinned to a specific version in the CI configuration. The implementation required only two simple changes in the GitHub Actions workflow file to update the version references.

The key technical insight here is that dependency management in CI systems requires proactive maintenance. While cargo-binstall is not a direct build dependency of Bevy itself, it's a critical tool in the project's CI pipeline for installing required utilities. The glibc detection fix in v1.12.4 specifically addresses compatibility with newer Linux distributions, preventing future CI failures when GitHub updates their runner images.

The impact of this change is maintaining reliable CI execution across different environments. Without this update, Bevy's CI could start failing intermittently as GitHub rolls out updated Ubuntu versions to their runners. The compatibility score of 96 indicates low risk, making this a safe upgrade.
