#### Description Translation
# Objective

As raised by @Jondolf, this type is `pub`, and useful for various consumers to ensure cleanup or debugging.

However, it doesn't offer any way to actually view the data.

## Solution

- Add a read-only view of the data.
- Don't add any (easy) way to mutate the data, as this presents a huge footgun.
- Implement Reflect and register the component so you can see it in inspectors nicely.

#### The Story of This Pull Request
The `ObservedBy` component in Bevy's ECS tracks which entities are observing a particular entity. While this component was publicly accessible, consumers couldn't inspect its contents. This limited its utility for debugging and cleanup operations. 

The core problem was that the `ObservedBy` struct contained a private vector of observer entities:
```rust
pub struct ObservedBy(pub(crate) Vec<Entity>);
```
This implementation prevented users from accessing the observer list, even though the component itself was public. 

To address this, we implemented a read-only accessor method:
```rust
impl ObservedBy {
    pub fn get(&self) -> &[Entity] {
        &self.0
    }
}
```
This provides immutable access to the observer list while preventing direct mutation, which could disrupt the ECS observer system's internal consistency. 

We then enhanced debuggability and editor support by:
1. Adding `Debug` derivation for better logging
2. Implementing reflection when the `bevy_reflect` feature is enabled:
```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "bevy_reflect", derive(bevy_reflect::Reflect))]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "bevy_reflect", reflect(Component, Debug))]
```

Finally, we registered the component in Bevy's type registry:
```rust
app.register_type::<ObservedBy>();
```
This allows the component to appear in editor inspectors, improving visibility during development.

These changes maintain the ECS observer system's encapsulation while providing necessary access for debugging and tooling. The implementation avoids exposing mutation methods to prevent accidental corruption of observer relationships.

```

#### Key Files Changed
1. **crates/bevy_ecs/src/observer/entity_observer.rs**  
   Added read-only access and reflection support:
   ```rust
   // Before:
   pub struct ObservedBy(pub(crate) Vec<Entity>);
   
   // After:
   #[derive(Default, Debug)]
   #[cfg_attr(feature = "bevy_reflect", derive(bevy_reflect::Reflect))]
   #[cfg_attr(feature = "bevy_reflect", reflect(Component, Debug))]
   pub struct ObservedBy(pub(crate) Vec<Entity>);
   
   impl ObservedBy {
       pub fn get(&self) -> &[Entity] {
           &self.0
       }
   }
   ```

2. **crates/bevy_app/src/app.rs**  
   Registered component for reflection:
   ```rust
   // Added to reflection registration:
   app.register_type::<ObservedBy>();
   ```
