### The Story of This Pull Request
This PR addresses Clippy warnings that surfaced when building `bevy_utils` without the `debug` feature enabled. The core issue centered around two types of warnings: redundant lifetime specifiers and missing `expect` reason attributes. These warnings created noise in the build output and violated the project's code quality standards.

The solution involved making surgical changes to the `DebugName` utility and its related methods. First, the redundant `'static` lifetime was removed from a constant string reference. Second, all `#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "debug"), expect(unused_variables))]` attributes were augmented with explicit reason clauses. This modification satisfies Clippy's requirement for documented expectations while maintaining the original conditional compilation behavior.

The changes preserve the existing functionality: When the `debug` feature is disabled, input values are intentionally discarded to avoid runtime overhead. The added `reason` attributes explicitly document this design choice, improving code maintainability. The author verified the fix by running `cargo clippy` with strict warning settings, confirming clean output.

This fix demonstrates good practice for conditional compilation scenarios. The explicit `reason` attributes serve as documentation for future maintainers, clarifying why certain variables appear unused in specific build configurations. The changes also align with Rust's best practices for handling Clippy expectations, ensuring the project maintains a warning-free build.

### Key Files Changed
#### `crates/bevy_utils/src/debug_info.rs`  
**Changes:**  
1. Removed redundant lifetime specifier  
2. Added reason clauses to `expect` attributes  
3. Maintained identical functionality for `debug` feature toggles  

**Code Snippets:**  
```rust
// Constant declaration fix
// Before:
const FEATURE_DISABLED: &'static str = "Enable...";

// After:
const FEATURE_DISABLED: &str = "Enable...";
```

```rust
// Updated expect attribute with reason
// Before:
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "debug"), expect(unused_variables))]

// After:
#[cfg_attr(
    not(feature = "debug"),
    expect(
        unused_variables,
        reason = "The value will be ignored if the `debug` feature is not enabled"
    )
)]
```
