## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a straightforward but important organizational issue in the Bevy engine's example structure. The `manual_material` example, which demonstrates how to implement a material manually using Bevy's mid-level render APIs, was previously categorized under "3D Rendering" alongside more basic examples. However, the example's content is specifically targeted at advanced users who need to work with lower-level rendering APIs.

The problem was one of discoverability and appropriate categorization. When users browse examples, they expect to find basic concepts in general categories and advanced techniques in specialized sections. Having an advanced material implementation example mixed with basic 3D rendering examples could confuse beginners and make it harder for advanced users to find the specialized examples they need.

The solution approach was simple and effective: move the example from the "3D Rendering" category to the "shader_advanced" category where it better belongs. This required three coordinated changes:

1. Updating the Cargo.toml configuration to change the example's category and path
2. Updating the examples README.md to reflect the new categorization
3. Physically moving the example file to the appropriate directory

The implementation demonstrates good software organization practices. By maintaining the example's functionality while improving its discoverability, the change enhances the developer experience without introducing any technical risk. The author confirmed the example still works after the move, which is crucial for maintaining code quality.

From an engineering perspective, this change follows the principle of organizing code by complexity and intended audience. The "shader_advanced" category is specifically designed for examples that require deeper understanding of Bevy's rendering system, making it the appropriate home for material implementation examples that use mid-level render APIs.

## Key Files Changed

### `Cargo.toml` (+11/-12)

This file contains the example configuration for Bevy's build system. The changes remove the example from the 3D Rendering section and add it to the Shader Advanced section.

```toml
# Before (removed from 3D Rendering section):
[[example]]
name = "manual_material"
path = "examples/3d/manual_material.rs"
doc-scrape-examples = true

[package.metadata.example.manual_material]
name = "Manual Material Implementation"
description = "Demonstrates how to implement a material manually using the mid-level render APIs"
category = "3D Rendering"
wasm = true

# After (added to Shader Advanced section):
[[example]]
name = "manual_material"
path = "examples/shader_advanced/manual_material.rs"
doc-scrape-examples = true

[package.metadata.example.manual_material]
name = "Manual Material Implementation"
description = "Demonstrates how to implement a material manually using the mid-level render APIs"
category = "Shader Advanced"
wasm = true
```

### `examples/README.md` (+7/-1)

The documentation file needed updates to reflect the example's new category location.

```markdown
# Before (in 3D Rendering section):
[Manual Material Implementation](../examples/3d/manual_material.rs) | Demonstrates how to implement a material manually using the mid-level render APIs

# After (removed from 3D Rendering, added to new Shader Advanced section):
### Shader Advanced

Example | Description
--- | ---
[Manual Material Implementation](../examples/shader_advanced/manual_material.rs) | Demonstrates how to implement a material manually using the mid-level render APIs
```

### `examples/shader_advanced/manual_material.rs` (+0/-0)

The example file itself was moved without any code changes:
- From: `examples/3d/manual_material.rs`
- To: `examples/shader_advanced/manual_material.rs`

The file similarity index of 100% confirms no functional changes were made to the example code.
