## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR represents a routine but important infrastructure maintenance task: updating a core GitHub Actions dependency across the entire Bevy project. The change is straightforward but touches a critical component of the CI/CD pipeline - the checkout action that handles repository cloning in all workflows.

The core problem being addressed is keeping dependencies current. Using outdated versions of GitHub Actions can lead to security vulnerabilities, missed performance improvements, and potential compatibility issues with newer GitHub runner versions. In this case, the actions/checkout dependency was being upgraded from version 5 to version 6, a major version bump that indicates breaking changes.

Looking at the release notes for actions/checkout v6.0.0, the key change is in how credentials are handled. Instead of storing credentials directly in the local git config, v6 now persists them to a separate file under `$RUNNER_TEMP`. This change requires a minimum Actions Runner version of v2.329.0 for Docker container action scenarios. The update also includes Node.js 24 support, which aligns with GitHub's runtime environment updates.

The implementation approach was systematic and comprehensive. The PR updated every single workflow file that used `actions/checkout@v5` to use `actions/checkout@v6` instead. This affected 11 different workflow files across various aspects of the project's automation:

- Continuous integration (CI) workflows
- Validation jobs
- Dependency management workflows
- Documentation builds
- Example execution workflows
- Release processes
- Weekly maintenance tasks

Each change followed the same pattern - a simple version bump from `v5` to `v6` in the `uses` directive. For example:

```yaml
# Before:
- uses: actions/checkout@v5

# After:  
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
```

This consistency makes the changes easy to review and understand. The fact that all 18 instances of `actions/checkout@v5` were updated to `v6` shows the thoroughness of the automated dependency management.

From a technical perspective, the most significant consideration was ensuring compatibility with the existing GitHub Actions runner infrastructure. The credential storage change in v6 requires runners to be at least version 2.329.0, which is a reasonable requirement given that GitHub maintains relatively current runner versions. The compatibility score badge in the PR description indicates that the upgrade should work without issues.

The impact of this change is primarily in security and maintainability. By moving credentials to a separate file rather than the git config, the checkout action improves security isolation. Additionally, staying current with dependency versions reduces the risk of running into deprecated features or security vulnerabilities in older versions.

This PR demonstrates the value of automated dependency management through Dependabot. The change was automatically generated, thoroughly tested with compatibility checks, and provides clear documentation of what changed and why. The maintainers were able to merge it with confidence, knowing that it had been vetted for compatibility and followed established patterns.

## Key Files Changed

The most significant files changed in this PR:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (+18/-18) - Main CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/validation-jobs.yml` (+6/-6) - Validation and testing workflows
- `.github/workflows/dependencies.yml` (+4/-4) - Dependency management workflows
- `.github/workflows/example-run.yml` (+3/-3) - Example execution workflows
- `.github/workflows/weekly.yml` (+3/-3) - Weekly maintenance tasks

For each file, the change was identical - updating the checkout action version:

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Before:
- uses: actions/checkout@v5

# After:
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
```

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/validation-jobs.yml  
# Before:
- uses: actions/checkout@v5

# After:
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
```

These changes ensure that all automated workflows use the latest version of the checkout action, providing security improvements and compatibility with current GitHub infrastructure.
