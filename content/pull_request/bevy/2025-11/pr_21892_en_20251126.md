# Objective

This is a follow up to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/21713/files

I noticed something weird in the migration guide --- the `asset_path` method was removed,
so proposed fix now yields
```
no method named `asset_path` found for mutable reference `&mut LoadContext<'c>` in the current scope
```

The actual change to get the original path is `.path().path()`

## Solution
Updated the migration guide
## Testing
I've played around with `load_context` in `GltfLoader` and checked the signatures the methods return

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a documentation error in a Bevy migration guide that was introduced by a previous API change. The issue was discovered during routine code maintenance when a developer noticed that the suggested migration path would result in a compilation error.

The core problem stemmed from PR #21713, which removed the `asset_path` method from `LoadContext`. However, the migration guide still referenced this removed method, creating a situation where developers following the official documentation would encounter a method-not-found compiler error.

The fix is straightforward but important: updating the migration guide to reflect the correct API usage. Instead of calling `load_context.asset_path().path()`, developers should now use `load_context.path().path()`. This change maintains the same functionality - accessing the underlying file path - but uses the correct method chain that aligns with the current API.

What's particularly notable about this fix is that it preserves the original intent while correcting the technical implementation. The migration guide still warns developers about the potential pitfalls of using the raw `Path` directly, as it doesn't support custom asset sources. This maintains the architectural guidance while fixing the immediate compilation issue.

The discovery of this issue through "Alice's merge train" highlights the value of systematic code review processes in catching documentation inconsistencies that might otherwise go unnoticed until they cause developer frustration.

## Key Files Changed

**File**: `release-content/migration-guides/load_context_asset_path.md`

This migration guide file contained an incorrect method reference that would cause compilation errors for developers following the migration instructions.

**Change**: Fixed the method chain from `asset_path().path()` to `path().path()`

```markdown
# Before:
- `load_context.path()` -> `load_context.asset_path().path()`

# After:
- `load_context.path()` -> `load_context.path().path()`
```

The change is minimal but critical - it ensures developers can successfully migrate their code without encountering compilation errors due to referencing a method that no longer exists in the API.
