# Remove "should be called each frame" in `GizmoBuffer` document.

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Remove "should be called each frame" in `GizmoBuffer` document.

## Description Translation
`GizmoBuffer` is used by both `GizmoAsset` and `Gizmos`, and the former doesn't require these methods to be called each frame.

# Objective

Fixes #21711

## Solution

- Remove those lines in the document.

## Testing

- Run `cargo doc` and no longer see those lines in the document of `GizmoAsset`.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a documentation inconsistency in the Bevy engine's gizmo system. The core issue was that the `GizmoBuffer` trait documentation contained misleading guidance about when its methods should be called.

The problem originated from the dual usage pattern of `GizmoBuffer`. This trait serves as the foundation for two different gizmo rendering systems: `Gizmos` and `GizmoAsset`. The `Gizmos` system operates on a per-frame basis, where gizmos are drawn and then cleared each frame. However, `GizmoAsset` provides persistent gizmos that can be stored and rendered across multiple frames without requiring regeneration.

The documentation inconsistency became apparent when examining methods like `draw_line_3d` in `gizmos.rs`:

```rust
/// Draw a line in 3D from `start` to `end`.
///
/// This should be called for each frame the line needs to be rendered.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # use bevy_gizmos::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_math::prelude::*;
/// # fn system(mut gizmos: Gizmos) {
/// gizmos.draw_line_3d(Vec3::ZERO, Vec3::ONE, Color::RED);
/// # }
/// ```
pub fn draw_line_3d(&mut self, start: Vec3, end: Vec3, color: Color) {
    self.draw_line_3d_gradient(start, end, color, color);
}
```

The problematic line "This should be called for each frame the line needs to be rendered" was technically correct for the `Gizmos` implementation but incorrect for the `GizmoAsset` implementation, which maintains persistent gizmos that don't require per-frame regeneration.

The solution approach was straightforward: remove all instances of this misleading documentation guidance across the entire `GizmoBuffer` trait and its implementations. This affected multiple modules including arcs, arrows, circles, curves, grids, and various primitive drawing methods.

From an engineering perspective, this change highlights the importance of accurate documentation, especially when traits serve multiple implementations with different behavioral contracts. The fix ensures that documentation accurately reflects the actual contract of the trait without imposing implementation-specific constraints on users.

The impact of this change is primarily on developer experience and code clarity. Developers using `GizmoAsset` will no longer be misled by documentation suggesting they need to regenerate gizmos each frame. This aligns the documentation with the actual capabilities and intended usage patterns of the system.

## Key Files Changed

The PR modified documentation comments across 8 files in the `bevy_gizmos` crate:

**File: `crates/bevy_gizmos/src/gizmos.rs`**
- Removed "should be called each frame" documentation from multiple line drawing methods including:
  - `draw_line_3d`
  - `draw_line_3d_gradient`
  - `draw_line_3d_directional`
  - `draw_line_3d_directional_gradient`
  - `draw_line_strip_3d`
  - `draw_line_strip_3d_gradient`
  - `draw_rect_3d`
  - `draw_cube_3d`
  - `draw_aabb_3d`
  - And several 2D line drawing methods

**Example change:**
```rust
// Before:
/// Draw a line in 3D from `start` to `end`.
///
/// This should be called for each frame the line needs to be rendered.
///
/// # Example

// After:
/// Draw a line in 3D from `start` to `end`.
///
/// # Example
```

**File: `crates/bevy_gizmos/src/arrows.rs`**
- Removed the documentation line from arrow drawing methods:
  - `draw_arrow_3d`
  - `draw_arrow_2d`
  - `draw_axes_3d`
  - `draw_axes_2d`

**File: `crates/bevy_gizmos/src/circles.rs`**
- Removed from circle and sphere drawing methods:
  - `draw_ellipse_3d`
  - `draw_ellipse_2d`
  - `draw_circle_2d`
  - `draw_sphere_3d`

**File: `crates/bevy_gizmos/src/curves.rs`**
- Removed from curve drawing methods in both 2D and 3D

**File: `crates/bevy_gizmos/src/grid.rs`**
- Removed from grid drawing methods for 2D and 3D grids

The changes were consistent across all files - simply removing the single problematic documentation line that incorrectly specified calling frequency requirements.
