https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/906bc14d735b0f29ca4faf1c3f39aff9080da94a/crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/condition.rs#L1167-L1168

## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request addresses a straightforward documentation issue in Bevy's ECS (Entity Component System) module. The problem was a typo in a comment that incorrectly described the logical operation used by the `Nor` system combinator.

The issue was discovered in the `condition.rs` file within Bevy's ECS crate, specifically in the documentation for the `Nor` type alias. The original comment incorrectly stated that the `Nor` combinator uses the `&&` (logical AND) operator when it actually uses the `||` (logical OR) operator.

In Bevy's ECS architecture, system combinators are used to combine multiple systems and create complex conditional logic. The `Nor` combinator specifically implements the logical NOR operation, which is the negation of the OR operation. The correct implementation should combine the outputs of two systems using OR and then invert the result, not use AND operations.

The fix was minimal but important for maintaining accurate documentation. Incorrect comments can mislead developers trying to understand the codebase and may lead to incorrect assumptions about how these combinators work. Since Bevy is a game engine where system execution order and conditions are critical, having precise documentation is essential for developers building complex game logic.

The change was submitted by baozaolaoba-top and quickly reviewed and merged by mockersf, indicating this was a clear and necessary correction. The PR was appropriately labeled with C-Docs (documentation change) and A-ECS (ECS area), reflecting its scope and purpose.

## Key Files Changed

- `crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/condition.rs` (+1/-1)

This file contains the system condition combinators in Bevy's ECS. The change corrects a documentation typo in the `Nor` type alias comment.

```rust
// File: crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/condition.rs
// Before:
/// Combines and inverts the outputs of two systems using the `&&` and `!` operators.
pub type Nor<A, B> = CombinatorSystem<NorMarker, A, B>;

// After:
/// Combines and inverts the outputs of two systems using the `||` and `!` operators.
pub type Nor<A, B> = CombinatorSystem<NorMarker, A, B>;
```

The correction changes the logical operator from `&&` (AND) to `||` (OR) in the comment, accurately reflecting that the `Nor` combinator performs a logical NOR operation by combining system outputs with OR and then applying negation.
