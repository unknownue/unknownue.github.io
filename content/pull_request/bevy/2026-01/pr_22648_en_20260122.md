## Description Translation
#22560 added this code:

```rust
.map(|file| GuardedFile {
    file,
    #[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
    _guard,
    #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
    _lifetime: PhantomData::default(),
})
```

But clippy says no!

```
error: use of `default` to create a unit struct

## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request addresses a minor but important code quality issue that surfaced in the Bevy asset system on Windows. The problem originated from PR #22560, which introduced conditional compilation logic for the `GuardedFile` struct in `FileAssetReader`. While the functional implementation was correct, it violated a Clippy lint rule that enforces Rust's idiomatic patterns.

The issue was straightforward: the code used `PhantomData::default()` to initialize a unit struct field on Windows builds. In Rust, unit structs (structs with no fields) can be instantiated directly without calling a constructor. The `default()` method returns the same unit value, but calling it is considered non-idiomatic and generates a Clippy warning. This is a code quality concern because it introduces unnecessary complexity and deviates from established Rust conventions.

The solution implemented here is minimal and direct. Instead of calling `PhantomData::default()`, the code now uses `PhantomData` directly. This change aligns with Rust's standard practice for instantiating zero-sized types (ZSTs) like `PhantomData`. The fix was applied consistently in both the `read` and `read_meta` methods of `FileAssetReader`, ensuring uniform code patterns across the module.

From a technical perspective, this fix demonstrates several important Rust concepts. First, `PhantomData` is a marker type used to indicate that a struct owns a generic type parameter or lifetime, even though it doesn't contain any actual data. Second, conditional compilation with `#[cfg]` attributes allows platform-specific code paths, which is essential for handling OS-specific file system semantics. The Windows version uses `PhantomData` as a placeholder for lifetime tracking, while the non-Windows version includes a `_guard` field for file locking or other platform-specific requirements.

The implementation shows good attention to detail by maintaining the same conditional compilation structure while cleaning up the instantiation pattern. This preserves the original intent of the code while adhering to Rust's idiomatic standards. The changes are localized and don't affect the broader architecture of the asset system—they're purely about code quality and lint compliance.

In terms of impact, this PR eliminates a Clippy warning that would otherwise fail CI checks on Windows. While the functional behavior remains unchanged, the code is now cleaner and more idiomatic. This is particularly important in a large codebase like Bevy where consistent coding patterns help maintain readability and reduce cognitive load for contributors. The fix also serves as a good example of how to properly instantiate unit structs in Rust, which can be educational for developers new to the language.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_asset/src/io/file/file_asset.rs`

1. **What changed and why**: The PR fixes a Clippy warning by replacing `PhantomData::default()` with `PhantomData` for unit struct instantiation in Windows-specific code paths.

2. **Code snippets showing key modifications**:

   Before (in `read` method):
   ```rust
   .map(|file| GuardedFile {
       file,
       #[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
       _guard,
       #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
       _lifetime: PhantomData::default(),
   })
   ```

   After:
   ```rust
   .map(|file| GuardedFile {
       file,
       #[cfg(not(target_os = "windows"))]
       _guard,
       #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
       _lifetime: PhantomData,
   })
   ```

   The same change was applied in the `read_meta` method (line 115).

3. **Relationship to overall purpose**: These changes directly address the Clippy warning by using idiomatic Rust syntax for instantiating unit structs, improving code quality while maintaining the same conditional compilation logic for Windows vs. non-Windows platforms.

## Further Reading

1. **Rust Clippy Documentation**: Understanding Clippy lints and how to address them is essential for Rust development. The official documentation provides details on various lints and their purposes.

2. **PhantomData in The Rustonomicon**: For developers unfamiliar with `PhantomData`, The Rustonomicon provides a comprehensive explanation of its purpose and usage patterns in generic programming.

3. **Conditional Compilation in Rust**: The Rust reference documentation on `#[cfg]` attributes explains how to write platform-specific code and manage conditional compilation effectively.

4. **Zero-Sized Types in Rust**: Understanding ZSTs like `PhantomData` is important for optimizing Rust code and understanding ownership semantics without runtime overhead.
