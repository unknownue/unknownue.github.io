## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR is a straightforward dependency update for the GitHub Actions workflows in the Bevy repository. Dependabot, GitHub's automated dependency management tool, identified that the `actions/cache` action used across multiple workflow files was outdated. The tool automatically created this PR to update from version 5.0.1 to 5.0.3.

The changes affect four GitHub Actions workflow files, all of which rely on `actions/cache` to speed up CI builds by caching Rust build artifacts. Caching is particularly important in Rust projects where dependencies can take significant time to download and compile. Without caching, each CI run would need to rebuild the entire dependency tree from scratch, wasting computational resources and slowing down development workflows.

Looking at the release notes for the updated versions, this update brings two main benefits:

1. **Security fixes**: Version 5.0.3 bumps `@actions/cache` to v5.0.5 to resolve a security vulnerability tracked as dependabot/33. While the specific details of the vulnerability aren't provided in the PR description, it's clear this addresses a known security issue in the underlying cache implementation.

2. **Behavior improvements**: Version 5.0.2 introduces a change where HTTP 429 (rate limit) responses from the cache service are no longer retried when creating cache entries. This prevents excessive retry loops that could potentially worsen rate limiting situations.

The implementation approach here is simple but systematic. Dependabot scans all workflow files for references to the `actions/cache` action and updates them consistently. The update replaces the specific commit hash (`9255dc7a253b0ccc959486e2bca901246202afeb`) with the newer one (`cdf6c1fa76f9f475f3d7449005a359c84ca0f306`) while also updating the version comment from `# v5.0.1` to `# v5.0.3`.

All changes follow the same pattern across files. For example, in the `ci.yml` workflow, multiple jobs that previously used `actions/cache/restore@9255dc7a253b0ccc959486e2bca901246202afeb # v5.0.1` now use `actions/cache/restore@cdf6c1fa76f9f475f3d7449005a359c84ca0f306 # v5.0.3`. This consistency is important because it ensures all cache operations use the same version throughout the CI system.

The PR was merged quickly (within about 53 minutes of creation), which is typical for dependency updates that don't introduce breaking changes. The compatibility score badge in the PR description shows a high compatibility score, indicating that the update is unlikely to cause issues with existing workflows.

From a technical perspective, this update demonstrates good dependency hygiene. Regularly updating dependencies, even for CI/CD tooling, helps maintain security and benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes. It also shows the value of automated dependency management tools like Dependabot in modern software development workflows.

## Key Files Changed

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (+11/-11)
This is the main CI workflow file. The changes update all instances of `actions/cache/restore` from version 5.0.1 to 5.0.3. This workflow includes multiple jobs for different platforms and toolchains (stable, nightly, various targets like WASM, and embedded systems).

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Before:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@9255dc7a253b0ccc959486e2bca901246202afeb # v5.0.1

# After:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@cdf6c1fa76f9f475f3d7449005a359c84ca0f306 # v5.0.3
```

### `.github/workflows/validation-jobs.yml` (+5/-5)
This workflow handles validation jobs for specific platforms like iOS, Android, and WASM. Each job uses `actions/cache/restore` to cache build artifacts for these specialized targets.

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/validation-jobs.yml
# Before:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@9255dc7a253b0ccc959486e2bca901246202afeb # v5.0.1

# After:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@cdf6c1fa76f9f475f3d7449005a359c84ca0f306 # v5.0.3
```

### `.github/workflows/example-run.yml` (+3/-3)
This workflow runs examples to ensure they compile and work correctly. It uses caching to speed up the compilation of example dependencies.

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/example-run.yml
# Before:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@9255dc7a253b0ccc959486e2bca901246202afeb # v5.0.1

# After:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@cdf6c1fa76f9f475f3d7449005a359c84ca0f306 # v5.0.3
```

### `.github/workflows/update-caches.yml` (+2/-2)
This workflow specifically manages cache updates. It uses both `actions/cache/restore` and `actions/cache/save`, both of which are updated to version 5.0.3.

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/update-caches.yml
# Before:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@9255dc7a253b0ccc959486e2bca901246202afeb # v5.0.1
- uses: actions/cache/save@9255dc7a253b0ccc959486e2bca901246202afeb # v5.0.1

# After:
- uses: actions/cache/restore@cdf6c1fa76f9f475f3d7449005a359c84ca0f306 # v5.0.3
- uses: actions/cache/save@cdf6c1fa76f9f475f3d7449005a359c84ca0f306 # v5.0.3
```
