## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR is a routine dependency update managed by Dependabot, GitHub's automated dependency management tool. The update addresses two specific false positives in the typos-checking tool used by the Bevy project's CI pipeline.

The Bevy project uses the `crate-ci/typos` GitHub Action in its continuous integration workflow to check for spelling errors in code and documentation. This is a standard practice in many open-source projects to maintain code quality and prevent common spelling mistakes from creeping into the codebase. However, like any automated tool, typos checkers can sometimes incorrectly flag legitimate terms as spelling errors - these are known as false positives.

In this case, version 1.42.1 of the typos tool had two issues: it incorrectly flagged the word "loosing" as a typo (when it should be "losing"), and it incorrectly flagged "substituters" as a typo. Both of these are legitimate technical terms that might appear in code or documentation. For "loosing", this could be particularly problematic in game development contexts where "loose" might be used in variable names related to physics or game mechanics. For "substituters", this is a technical term that appears in various programming contexts.

The fix came in two separate releases: version 1.42.2 addressed the "substituters" issue, and version 1.42.3 addressed the "loosing" issue. Each release contained a single fix to the tool's dictionary, explicitly allowing these previously flagged terms. This is evident from the commit history where commit `5b5d298` added "Don't correct substituters" and commit `01fbc2d` added "Allow loosing".

The PR process here is automated: Dependabot detected that a newer version of the typos action was available, created this PR with the update, and provided comprehensive release notes and changelog information. The maintainer then reviewed and merged the PR after the CI checks passed, which is a straightforward process since this is a patch version update (from 1.42.1 to 1.42.3) that only includes bug fixes for false positives, not any breaking changes or new features.

This type of maintenance work is essential for keeping CI tools up-to-date and minimizing false positives that can waste developer time. False positives in automated checks create noise that can lead to developers ignoring legitimate warnings or spending time investigating non-issues. By promptly updating to versions that fix these false positives, the Bevy project maintains the effectiveness of its automated code quality checks.

## Key Files Changed

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (+1/-1)

This is the only file changed in this PR. The update modifies the GitHub Actions workflow configuration to use a newer version of the `crate-ci/typos` action.

**What changed and why**: The version of the `crate-ci/typos` GitHub Action was updated from commit hash `65120634e79d8374d1aa2f27e54baa0c364fff5a` (which corresponds to version 1.42.1) to commit hash `06d010dfe4c84fdab1a25ea02b57b3585018ba80` (which corresponds to version 1.42.3). This update incorporates bug fixes that prevent false positives for the words "loosing" and "substituters".

**Code snippets**:

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Before:
- name: Check for typos
  uses: crate-ci/typos@65120634e79d8374d1aa2f27e54baa0c364fff5a # v1.42.1

# After:
- name: Check for typos
  uses: crate-ci/typos@06d010dfe4c84fdab1a25ea02b57b3585018ba80 # v1.42.3
```

**How this relates to the overall purpose**: This single-line change updates the typos checker to a version with fewer false positives, making the CI checks more accurate and reducing noise for developers. The change is minimal because it's a simple version bump for a dependency in the CI pipeline.
