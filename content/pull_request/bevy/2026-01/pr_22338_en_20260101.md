## Description Translation
# Objective

## Solution

- Do it now

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR is a straightforward maintenance operation that addresses a version control housekeeping issue. During the Bevy development cycle, each major release generates two categories of documentation files: migration guides (for developers upgrading between versions) and release notes (for users to understand new features). These files live in the `release-content` directory and are version-specific.

The problem emerged when the development team began preparing for the 0.19 release. New PRs started adding 0.19 release content to the repository while the 0.18 release content remained in place. This created a situation where outdated documentation coexisted with current documentation, which could lead to confusion for contributors browsing the main branch. Outdated files might be mistaken for current information, and the repository accumulated unnecessary historical documentation that should instead be accessed through release tags.

The solution was direct and mechanical: delete all 87 files related to the 0.18 release. This includes migration guides like `gltf-coordinate-conversion.md` and `entities_apis.md`, and release notes like `ring_primitive.md` and `generalized_atmosphere.md`. These files served their purpose during the 0.18 release cycle but are no longer needed in the main development branch.

From an engineering perspective, this change carries minimal risk. The removed files are static documentation that remains accessible through Git history and the 0.18 release tag. No code functionality is affected. The operation demonstrates good repository hygiene—keeping the main branch focused on current development reduces cognitive overhead for contributors and maintainers.

The PR was reviewed and merged quickly (within about an hour), indicating consensus on its necessity. The "A-Meta" label correctly categorizes it as a project maintenance task, while "S-Ready-For-Review" suggests it passed initial checks. The rapid merge by a core maintainer reflects the straightforward nature of the change and alignment with project maintenance practices.

This type of cleanup is essential in large projects with regular release cycles. It prevents documentation sprawl and ensures that developers working from the main branch encounter only relevant, current information. The PR exemplifies the practical, no-nonsense maintenance required to keep a large codebase manageable.
