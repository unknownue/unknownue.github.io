Objective:

- Add regression test

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a critical bug in Bevy's visibility system where entities that became visible would remain permanently visible and couldn't be hidden again. The bug was introduced in a previous PR (#22226) and affected the `ViewVisibility` component's state management.

The core issue was in the `ViewVisibility::update()` method, which handles the transition between visibility states across frames. The system uses bit flags to track both current and previous visibility states. The bug occurred because the bit-shifting operation didn't properly clear the current state bit after copying it to the previous state position.

Looking at the original implementation before the fix:
```rust
// Copy the first bit (current) to the second bit position (previous)
// Clear the second bit, then set it based on the first bit
self.0 = (self.0 & !2) | ((self.0 & 1) << 1);
```

The problem with this approach is subtle. While it correctly copies the current bit (bit 0) to the previous position (bit 1), it doesn't clear the current bit. This means that once an entity becomes visible (bit 0 = 1), that bit never gets cleared, causing the entity to remain permanently visible.

The fix is straightforward and more elegant:
```rust
// Copy the first bit (current) to the second bit position (previous)
// and clear the first bit (current).
self.0 = (self.0 & 1) << 1;
```

This revised implementation does two things correctly:
1. It isolates the current state bit (`self.0 & 1`)
2. It shifts that bit left to the previous state position (`<< 1`)
3. Crucially, it doesn't OR (`|`) with the original value, which means the current bit position automatically becomes 0 (cleared)

The bug manifested as entities that would become visible once and then remain visible indefinitely, regardless of subsequent visibility changes. This is particularly problematic in games and applications where dynamic visibility is essential for performance (culling off-screen objects) or gameplay mechanics (hiding/showing objects based on player actions).

The PR also adds a comprehensive regression test `view_visibility_lifecycle()` that validates the correct behavior through multiple frames:
- Frame 1: Entity starts hidden, no change expected
- Frame 2: Entity manually marked as visible, should become visible and trigger change detection
- Frame 3: No manual marking, entity should become hidden again and trigger change detection
- Frame 4: No manual marking, entity should remain hidden with no change detection

The test uses a custom system that can manually mark entities as visible and another system that observes visibility changes. This approach ensures that the visibility lifecycle works correctly across multiple frames and that change detection behaves as expected.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_camera/src/visibility/mod.rs` (+120/-2)

This file contains the core visibility system implementation. Two key changes were made:

1. **Fixed the `ViewVisibility::update()` method**:
```rust
// Before (buggy):
#[inline]
fn update(&mut self) {
    // Copy the first bit (current) to the second bit position (previous)
    // Clear the second bit, then set it based on the first bit
    self.0 = (self.0 & !2) | ((self.0 & 1) << 1);
}

// After (fixed):
#[inline]
fn update(&mut self) {
    // Copy the first bit (current) to the second bit position (previous)
    // and clear the first bit (current).
    self.0 = (self.0 & 1) << 1;
}
```

The fix simplifies the bit manipulation by removing the OR operation with the original value. This ensures that after shifting the current bit to the previous position, the current bit position is always 0 (cleared).

2. **Added comprehensive regression test**:
The test `view_visibility_lifecycle()` validates the correct behavior of the visibility system across multiple frames. It creates an entity with `ViewVisibility::HIDDEN` and then:
- Tests that the entity remains hidden when not marked
- Tests that marking it visible works correctly
- Tests that it becomes hidden again when the mark is removed
- Tests that change detection triggers appropriately
