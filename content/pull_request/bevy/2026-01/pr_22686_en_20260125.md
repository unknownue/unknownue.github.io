## Description Translation

# Objective

Follow-up to #22290

Currently, when calling `resource_scope` or `try_resource_scope`, the function will panic or return `None`, respectively, if `World::clear_resources` is called from within the scope. This behavior was intentionally preserved in #22290 to reduce user-facing changes, however the behavior is not necessary, as, at the point where it becomes relevant, the user-provided scope closure has already completed successfully. Since we explicitly support methods such as `clear_resources`, we should treat them as valid to call, and avoid causing unnecessary knock-on errors.

## Testing

A test added in #22290 was updated to reflect the new behavior.

# The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a specific edge case in Bevy's ECS system involving the `World::resource_scope` and `World::try_resource_scope` methods. The issue stemmed from how these methods handled resource metadata cleanup operations performed within the scope.

## The Problem and Context

In Bevy's Entity Component System, `resource_scope` provides a safe way to temporarily remove a resource from the world, work with it, and then reinsert it. This is particularly useful for operations that need exclusive access to a resource. The method uses a guard pattern where a `ReinsertGuard` struct handles the reinsertion in its `Drop` implementation.

The problem arose when users called methods like `World::clear_resources()` or `World::clear_all()` from within the resource scope. These methods clear resource metadata, which would break the reinsertion logic. In PR #22290, the behavior was preserved to minimize user-facing changes - the methods would panic (`resource_scope`) or return `None` (`try_resource_scope`) when this occurred.

However, this behavior created an inconsistency. The user's closure had already executed successfully, but the API would still indicate failure. This was problematic because methods like `clear_resources` are explicitly supported operations, and calling them within a resource scope should be treated as valid use cases.

## The Solution Approach

The solution was straightforward: remove the failure condition when resource metadata is cleared within the scope. Since the user's closure has already completed successfully by the time reinsertion would fail, there's no need to signal an error. The resource simply won't be reinserted, which is the expected behavior when someone explicitly clears resources.

This change required modifying two key aspects:
1. Removing the success tracking mechanism from `ReinsertGuard`
2. Updating the return value logic to always return `Some(result)` from `try_resource_scope`

## The Implementation

The implementation focused on the `try_resource_scope` method in `world/mod.rs`. The key change was removing the `was_successful` flag and its associated logic. Previously, the `ReinsertGuard` had a mutable reference to a boolean flag that tracked whether reinsertion succeeded. This flag was used to determine whether to return `Some(result)` or `None`.

The updated implementation simplifies the control flow. The `ReinsertGuard` no longer needs to track success, and `try_resource_scope` always returns `Some(result)`. The guard's `Drop` implementation still attempts to reinsert the resource, but if the resource metadata has been cleared (e.g., by `clear_resources`), the reinsertion is simply skipped.

Here's the core change in `ReinsertGuard`:

```rust
// Before:
struct ReinsertGuard<'a, R> {
    world: &'a mut World,
    component_id: ComponentId,
    value: ManuallyDrop<R>,
    ticks: ComponentTicks,
    caller: MaybeLocation,
    was_successful: &'a mut bool,  // Tracks success for return value
}

// After:
struct ReinsertGuard<'a, R> {
    world: &'a mut World,
    component_id: ComponentId,
    value: ManuallyDrop<R>,
    ticks: ComponentTicks,
    caller: MaybeLocation,
    // was_successful field removed
}
```

The `Drop` implementation was also simplified:

```rust
// Before: Set was_successful flag on successful reinsertion
impl<R> Drop for ReinsertGuard<'_, R> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // ... reinsertion logic ...
        *self.was_successful = true;  // This line removed
    }
}

// After: No success tracking needed
impl<R> Drop for ReinsertGuard<'_, R> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // ... reinsertion logic (same but without setting flag) ...
    }
}
```

The return logic in `try_resource_scope` was simplified from:

```rust
let mut was_successful = false;
let result = {
    // ... setup guard with &mut was_successful ...
    f(guard.world, value_mut)
};
was_successful.then_some(result)
```

To:

```rust
let result = f(guard.world, value_mut);
Some(result)  // Always return Some
```

## Technical Insights

This change demonstrates an important principle in API design: when a user performs an explicit, supported operation (like clearing resources), the API should not treat it as an error condition. The previous implementation was trying to protect against a scenario that users might intentionally want.

The guard pattern used here is a common Rust idiom for managing resources that need cleanup. By removing the success tracking, the implementation becomes simpler and more predictable. The `Drop` implementation still provides the basic safety guarantee - it attempts to reinsert if possible, but doesn't fail if the world state has changed.

The PR also adds documentation notes to both methods warning users that if they clear resource metadata within the scope, the resource won't be reinserted. This is a better approach than failing at runtime - it documents the behavior and lets users decide if that's what they want.

## The Impact

The impact of this change is primarily on code correctness and developer experience:

1. **Reduced unexpected failures**: Code that legitimately clears resources within a resource scope will no longer fail unexpectedly.
2. **Simpler control flow**: The removal of the success tracking logic makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Better API consistency**: The methods now behave more consistently with other World operations.
4. **Updated documentation**: The added notes provide clear guidance on the behavior when resource metadata is cleared.

The test update reflects this new behavior - instead of expecting `None` when `clear_resources` is called within the scope, it now expects `Some(())`.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/world/mod.rs` (+31/-33)

This file contains the main implementation change. The `try_resource_scope` method was modified to always return `Some(result)` regardless of whether the resource was reinserted. The `ReinsertGuard` struct was simplified by removing the `was_successful` field.

Key changes:

1. Added documentation notes warning that resources won't be reinserted if metadata is cleared.
2. Removed the `was_successful` tracking mechanism from `ReinsertGuard`.
3. Simplified the return logic to always return `Some(result)`.

```rust
// File: crates/bevy_ecs/src/world/mod.rs
// Before: Complex success tracking
pub fn try_resource_scope<R: Resource, U>(
    &mut self,
    f: impl FnOnce(&mut World, Mut<R>) -> U,
) -> Option<U> {
    // ... setup ...
    let mut was_successful = false;
    let result = {
        // ... guard with was_successful reference ...
        f(guard.world, value_mut)
    };
    was_successful.then_some(result)
}

// After: Always returns Some
pub fn try_resource_scope<R: Resource, U>(
    &mut self,
    f: impl FnOnce(&mut World, Mut<R>) -> U,
) -> Option<U> {
    // ... setup (without was_successful) ...
    let result = f(guard.world, value_mut);
    Some(result)  // Always return Some
}
```

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/lib.rs` (+1/-3)

This file contains test updates. The test comment was removed (as it was no longer accurate), and the assertion was updated to expect `Some(())` instead of `None`.

```rust
// File: crates/bevy_ecs/src/lib.rs
// Before:
#[test]
fn resource_scope_resources_cleared() {
    let mut world = World::default();
    world.insert_resource(ResA(0));
    let r = world.try_resource_scope(|world, _res_a: Mut<ResA>| {
        assert!(!world.contains_resource::<ResA>());
        world.clear_resources();
    });
    assert_eq!(r, None);  // Expected None when resources cleared
    assert!(!world.contains_resource::<ResA>());
}

// After:
#[test]
fn resource_scope_resources_cleared() {
    let mut world = World::default();
    world.insert_resource(ResA(0));
    let r = world.try_resource_scope(|world, _res_a: Mut<ResA>| {
        assert!(!world.contains_resource::<ResA>());
        world.clear_resources();
    });
    assert_eq!(r, Some(()));  // Now expects Some(())
    assert!(!world.contains_resource::<ResA>());
}
```
