## The Story of This Pull Request

This is a straightforward dependency update PR generated automatically by Dependabot. The PR updates the GitHub CodeQL Action from version 4.31.10 to 4.32.0 in Bevy's security static analysis workflow.

The Bevy project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and code quality checks. One of these workflows is `security-static-analysis.yml`, which runs CodeQL static analysis to identify security vulnerabilities and coding errors. CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that can detect many classes of bugs across multiple programming languages.

The update addresses two specific steps in the workflow: the CodeQL initialization step (`github/codeql-action/init`) and the analysis step (`github/codeql-action/analyze`). Both were updated from commit hash `cdefb33c0f6224e58673d9004f47f7cb3e328b89` (v4.31.10) to `b20883b0cd1f46c72ae0ba6d1090936928f9fa30` (v4.32.0).

Looking at the release notes, the main change in v4.32.0 is an update to the default CodeQL bundle version to 2.24.0. The CodeQL bundle includes the CodeQL CLI tool and language packs needed for analysis. This update brings improvements and bug fixes from the underlying CodeQL engine.

The PR also includes changes from the intermediate version 4.31.11, which introduced several improvements:
- Better artifact naming for Dependabot authentication proxy logs when Actions debugging is enabled, preventing naming conflicts in build matrix jobs
- Improved error handling throughout the CodeQL Action
- Experimental support for automatically excluding generated files from analysis (though not enabled by default yet)

The update follows standard dependency management practices. The workflow file pins specific versions using commit hashes rather than tags or branches, which is a security best practice to prevent supply chain attacks. This approach ensures that the exact same version of the Action is used every time, providing deterministic builds.

The PR was created by Dependabot, GitHub's automated dependency update tool. Dependabot monitors project dependencies and automatically creates PRs when updates are available. The tool includes a compatibility score badge (93 out of 100 in this case) that indicates how likely the update is to be compatible with the existing codebase.

The maintainers merged this PR quickly (within about an hour of creation), which suggests this was a routine update that passed all CI checks. The fast merge indicates confidence in the update and the automated testing pipeline.

This type of dependency maintenance is important for several reasons:
1. **Security**: Keeping security tooling updated ensures the latest vulnerability checks are running against the codebase
2. **Bug fixes**: Updates include fixes for issues in previous versions of the CodeQL Action
3. **Performance**: Newer versions may include performance improvements for faster analysis
4. **Feature access**: Updates provide access to new analysis capabilities and language support

The minimal nature of the change (only two lines updated) demonstrates the value of automated dependency management. Without Dependabot, maintaining dozens of dependencies across a large project like Bevy would be time-consuming and error-prone.

## Key Files Changed

### `.github/workflows/security-static-analysis.yml` (+2/-2)

This is the only file modified in the PR. The changes update the version of the GitHub CodeQL Action used in Bevy's security static analysis workflow.

**Before:**
```yaml
# Line 45
- name: Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@cdefb33c0f6224e58673d9004f47f7cb3e328b89 # v4.31.10

# Line 73  
- name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
  uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@cdefb33c0f6224e58673d9004f47f7cb3e328b89 # v4.31.10
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Line 45
- name: Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@b20883b0cd1f46c72ae0ba6d1090936928f9fa30 # v4.32.0

# Line 73
- name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
  uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@b20883b0cd1f46c72ae0ba6d1090936928f9fa30 # v4.32.0
```

The changes are minimal but important:
1. Both references to the CodeQL Action are updated from version 4.31.10 to 4.32.0
2. The commit hashes are updated accordingly (`cdefb33c0f6224e58673d9004f47f7cb3e328b89` → `b20883b0cd1f46c72ae0ba6d1090936928f9fa30`)
3. The inline comments are updated to reflect the new version number

These updates ensure that Bevy's security scanning uses the latest version of CodeQL with all recent improvements and bug fixes.
