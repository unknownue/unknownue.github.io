-Bevy now supports **automatic directional navigation graph generation** for UI elements! No more tedious manual wiring of navigation connections for your menus and UI screens.
+Bevy now supports **automatic directional navigation** for UI elements! No more tedious manual wiring of navigation connections for your menus and UI screens.
 
 ## What's New?
 
 Previously, creating directional navigation for UI required manually defining every connection between focusable elements using `DirectionalNavigationMap`. For dynamic UIs or complex layouts, this was time-consuming and error-prone.
 
-Now, you can simply add the `AutoDirectionalNavigation` component to your UI entities, and Bevy will automatically compute navigation connections based on spatial positioning. The system intelligently finds the nearest neighbor in each of the 8 compass directions (North, Northeast, East, etc.), considering:

The system parameter intelligently finds the nearest neighbor in each of the 8 compass directions (North, Northeast, East, etc.), considering:
 
 - **Distance**: Closer elements are preferred
 - **Alignment**: Elements that are more directly in line with the navigation direction are favored

-That's it! The `DirectionalNavigationPlugin` includes a system that automatically maintains the navigation graph as your UI changes.
+To leverage automatic navigation, use the `AutoDirectionalNavigator` system parameter instead of the `DirectionalNavigation` system parameter:
+
+```rust
+fn my_navigation_system(mut auto_directional_navigator: AutoDirectionalNavigator) {
+    // ...
+    auto_directional_navigator.navigate(CompassOctant::East);
+    // ...
+}
+```

+That's it! The `DirectionalNavigationPlugin` will set up the resources that `AutoDirectionalNavigator` uses to function.
