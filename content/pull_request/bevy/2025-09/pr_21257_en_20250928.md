## Description Translation
# Objective

There seems to be no way to get the underlying `Cow<'static, str>` from the `DebugName`.

This is useful for me to be able to use `DebugName` and have it interop seamlessly with the `metrics` crate: https://docs.rs/metrics/latest/metrics/type.SharedString.html

which is the standard why to register/record metrics in rust.

Is it possible to include this in 0.17?

## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request addresses a straightforward but important integration gap in the Bevy engine's utility types. The developer encountered a practical interoperability issue while working with the `metrics` crate, which is commonly used for instrumentation and observability in Rust applications.

The core problem was that `DebugName`, a utility type in Bevy designed for conditional debug information, didn't provide direct access to its underlying `Cow<'static, str>` representation. This created friction when trying to use `DebugName` with external libraries like `metrics`, which expects `SharedString` (a type alias for `Cow<'static, str>`) for metric registration.

The solution implemented is a clean, idiomatic Rust conversion trait. By adding an `impl From<DebugName> for Cow<'static, str>`, the developer enabled seamless interoperability between Bevy's debug utilities and the broader Rust ecosystem. This approach follows Rust's convention of using the `From` trait for type conversions, making the API intuitive for Rust developers.

The implementation carefully handles conditional compilation scenarios. Since `DebugName` itself is conditionally compiled based on the `debug` feature, the conversion implementation maintains this behavior:

- When the `debug` feature is enabled, it returns the actual stored name
- When the `debug` feature is disabled, it returns a constant "feature disabled" string

The code includes a thoughtful `expect` attribute to suppress the `unused_variables` warning that would normally occur when the `debug` feature is disabled, since the `value` parameter isn't used in that compilation path. This demonstrates attention to detail in maintaining clean compiler output.

This change is particularly valuable because it enables developers to use Bevy's debug utilities in instrumentation code without awkward workarounds. The `metrics` crate integration is a common use case in production applications, making this a practical quality-of-life improvement.

The implementation is minimal and focused, adding only the necessary conversion without modifying existing functionality. This reduces the risk of introducing regressions while providing the desired interoperability.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_utils/src/debug_info.rs` (+20/-0)

This file contains the `DebugName` type definition and its associated implementations. The change adds a new conversion implementation that allows `DebugName` to be converted to `Cow<'static, str>`.

**Key modification:**
```rust
impl From<DebugName> for Cow<'static, str> {
    #[cfg_attr(
        not(feature = "debug"),
        expect(
            unused_variables,
            reason = "The value will be ignored if the `debug` feature is not enabled"
        )
    )]
    fn from(value: DebugName) -> Self {
        #[cfg(feature = "debug")]
        {
            value.name
        }
        #[cfg(not(feature = "debug"))]
        {
            Cow::Borrowed(FEATURE_DISABLED)
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation:
- Uses conditional compilation to handle both debug and non-debug scenarios
- Returns the actual stored name when debug features are enabled
- Returns a constant "feature disabled" string when debug features are disabled
- Includes compiler attribute to handle unused variable warnings appropriately

The change integrates naturally with the existing `DebugName` API and maintains the same conditional compilation behavior that the type already exhibits.
