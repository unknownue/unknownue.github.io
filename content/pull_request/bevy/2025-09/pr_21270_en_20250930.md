## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request represents a routine but important maintenance task in the Bevy project's development workflow. The core issue being addressed is keeping the project's development tooling up to date with the latest improvements and bug fixes.

The problem was straightforward: the Bevy project uses crate-ci/typos, a GitHub Action that scans code for spelling errors, as part of its continuous integration pipeline. The project was using version 1.36.2 of this tool, and version 1.36.3 had been released with a specific fix for a dictionary correction issue. The technical constraint here is maintaining code quality through automated spell checking without introducing false positives from the tool itself.

The solution approach was equally straightforward - update the dependency version in the GitHub Actions workflow file. This is a standard practice in software development where keeping dependencies current ensures access to the latest bug fixes and improvements. The engineering decision here was to trust the semantic versioning of the typos tool, where a patch version bump (from 1.36.2 to 1.36.3) indicates backward-compatible bug fixes.

The implementation consisted of a single-line change in the CI configuration file. The specific fix in typos 1.36.3 addressed an issue where the tool was incorrectly correcting "analysises" - this demonstrates how even tools designed to catch errors can themselves contain errors that need fixing.

From a technical perspective, this update illustrates several important concepts in modern software development:

1. **Dependency management**: The use of automated tools like Dependabot to track and propose dependency updates
2. **Continuous integration hygiene**: Maintaining up-to-date tooling in CI pipelines
3. **Semantic versioning**: Understanding that patch version updates typically contain only bug fixes
4. **Quality assurance tooling**: The role of automated spell checking in maintaining code quality

The impact of this change is subtle but meaningful. By updating to the fixed version, Bevy ensures that its spell checking won't incorrectly flag or correct valid terminology. This prevents potential confusion for contributors and maintains the integrity of the codebase's documentation and comments. The high compatibility score (as shown in the dependabot badge) indicates minimal risk in making this update.

## Key Files Changed

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

This file contains the GitHub Actions workflow configuration for Bevy's continuous integration pipeline. The change updates the version of the crate-ci/typos action used in the spell checking job.

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Before:
- name: Check for typos
  uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.36.2

# After:
- name: Check for typos
  uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.36.3
```

This single-line change updates the typos checker from version 1.36.2 to 1.36.3, incorporating the bug fix that prevents incorrect corrections for the word "analysises". The change is located in the spell checking job of the CI pipeline, which runs as part of the project's quality assurance process.
