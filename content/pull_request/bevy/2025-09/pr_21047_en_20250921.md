## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR represents a routine but important maintenance task in the Bevy project's development workflow. Dependabot, GitHub's automated dependency management tool, detected that the crate-ci/typos action used in the CI pipeline had newer versions available and automatically created this update request.

The core issue was straightforward: the project's CI configuration was using an outdated version (1.35.5) of the typos checking tool. While this might seem minor, maintaining current dependencies ensures access to the latest bug fixes, performance improvements, and feature enhancements. The newer versions (1.36.0 through 1.36.2) included several meaningful improvements: an updated dictionary with August 2025 changes, improved error rendering for better developer experience, and a critical fix for handling invalid UTF-8 sequences without panicking.

What makes this PR particularly interesting is that it demonstrates the immediate value of keeping tooling updated. During the update process, the newer typos checker version identified and helped fix an actual typo in the codebase itself - changing "columnts" to "columns" in a comment within the ECS module. This shows how maintenance tasks can have immediate, tangible benefits for code quality.

The implementation approach was minimal and surgical: update the version reference in the GitHub Actions workflow file. The change followed semantic versioning practices, moving from a patch version (1.35.5) to a minor version update (1.36.2), indicating backward-compatible changes with new functionality.

From an engineering perspective, this update improves the robustness of the CI pipeline. The UTF-8 handling fix in version 1.36.2 is particularly valuable as it prevents potential CI failures when processing files with encoding issues, making the workflow more resilient. The updated dictionary also means more comprehensive spell checking across the codebase.

The PR was merged after standard review processes, indicating the changes were well-understood and presented minimal risk to the project. The high compatibility score (96%) shown in the dependabot badge provided additional confidence in the update's safety.

## Key Files Changed

### 1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Change**: Updated the crate-ci/typos GitHub Action from v1.35.5 to v1.36.2

**Code Diff**:
```yaml
# Before:
-        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.35.5

# After:
+        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.36.2
```

**Impact**: This change ensures the CI pipeline uses the latest version of the typos checking tool with improved error handling, updated dictionaries, and better UTF-8 processing capabilities.

### 2. `crates/bevy_ecs/src/storage/table/mod.rs`

**Change**: Fixed a typo in documentation comment ("columnts" → "columns")

**Code Diff**:
```rust
// Before:
/// it must be the correct capacity to allocate, reallocate, and deallocate all columnts. This

// After:
/// it must be the correct capacity to allocate, reallocate, and deallocate all columns. This
```

**Impact**: This correction improves code documentation clarity and demonstrates the immediate value of keeping linting tools updated. The comment explains memory management safety invariants in the ECS table implementation, where precision in documentation is particularly important.
