## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR represents a routine but important maintenance task in the Bevy project's GitHub Actions workflow infrastructure. The changes are straightforward but demonstrate the project's commitment to keeping dependencies current and maintaining a secure, efficient CI/CD pipeline.

The core issue addressed here is dependency version management. The Bevy project was using version 7 of the `actions/github-script` action across multiple workflow files. This GitHub Action provides a convenient way to execute JavaScript code in workflows with pre-authenticated GitHub API client access, making it essential for various automation tasks in the project's CI pipeline.

The upgrade to version 8 brings several technical benefits. The most significant change is the update to Node.js 24.x runtime support, which provides access to newer JavaScript features, performance improvements, and security updates. This version bump also requires GitHub Actions runners to be at least version v2.327.1, ensuring the project uses a modern, supported runner environment.

From an engineering perspective, this change follows standard dependency management practices. The upgrade path is straightforward since the major version change from 7 to 8 doesn't introduce breaking API changes that would affect Bevy's usage patterns. The compatibility score indicates high backward compatibility, making this a low-risk update.

The implementation involved simple version string updates across four workflow files. Each change follows the same pattern: replacing `actions/github-script@v7` with `actions/github-script@v8`. This consistency makes the changes easy to review and verify.

These updates ensure that Bevy's CI pipeline benefits from the latest security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements in the github-script action. It also maintains compatibility with the evolving GitHub Actions ecosystem, reducing the risk of future integration issues.

```

## Key Files Changed

The PR updates four GitHub Actions workflow files to use the newer version of the github-script action:

1. **`.github/workflows/ci-comment-failures.yml`** (+6/-6)
   - This workflow handles commenting on PRs when CI failures occur
   - Changes ensure failure reporting uses the updated github-script version

2. **`.github/workflows/action-on-PR-labeled.yml`** (+2/-2)
   - Automates actions when PRs receive specific labels
   - Updates the script execution environment for label-based automation

3. **`.github/workflows/example-run-report.yml`** (+1/-1)
   - Generates reports for example runs
   - Maintains compatibility with GitHub Actions ecosystem changes

4. **`.github/workflows/welcome.yml`** (+1/-1)
   - Handles welcome messages for new contributors
   - Ensures newcomer automation uses current dependencies

Each file follows the same simple change pattern:

```yaml
# Before:
- uses: actions/github-script@v7

# After:  
- uses: actions/github-script@v8
```

These changes are minimal but important for maintaining the project's CI/CD infrastructure with current, supported dependencies.
