## Description Translation
# Objective

Clean up some more doc links.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a common documentation readability issue in Rust projects: overly verbose path references in doc comments. When generating documentation, Rust's `rustdoc` tool creates links to referenced types, but these can become excessively long when they include full module paths, making the documentation harder to read.

The developer identified several instances where documentation links used the full crate path syntax (`[crate::some::module::Type]`) and replaced them with the more concise display text format (`[DisplayText](link)`). This approach maintains the same functionality - the links still work correctly in the generated documentation - while significantly improving readability.

The changes follow a consistent pattern across multiple crates in the Bevy engine, demonstrating systematic attention to documentation quality. Each modification replaces verbose path references with cleaner alternatives that hide the full path while preserving the link functionality.

The implementation required careful attention to Rust's documentation syntax. The developer used the format `[DisplayText](link_path)` where:
- `DisplayText` is the visible text in the documentation
- `link_path` is the actual path that rustdoc will resolve

This approach follows Rust's standard documentation conventions and doesn't introduce any new dependencies or architectural changes. It's purely a documentation cleanup effort that improves the developer experience when reading through the codebase or generated docs.

The changes affect several core systems including animation, asset management, color operations, and picking functionality. Despite touching multiple areas of the codebase, the modifications are isolated to documentation comments and don't impact runtime behavior or API contracts.

### `crates/bevy_animation/src/animation_curves.rs` (+2/-2)
**Change**: Improved documentation links for better readability
```rust
// Before:
/// A low-level trait for use in [`crate::VariableCurve`] that provides fine

// After:
/// A low-level trait for use in [`VariableCurve`](`crate::VariableCurve`) that provides fine
```

```rust
// Before:
/// evaluating the [`crate::graph::AnimationGraph`], while the blend register

// After:
/// evaluating the [`AnimationGraph`](`crate::graph::AnimationGraph`), while the blend register
```

### `crates/bevy_animation/src/graph.rs` (+1/-1)
**Change**: Cleaned up animation curve evaluator reference
```rust
// Before:
/// [`crate::animation_curves::AnimationCurveEvaluator`] uses a stack for

// After:
/// [`AnimationCurveEvaluator`](`crate::animation_curves::AnimationCurveEvaluator`) uses a stack for
```

### `crates/bevy_asset/src/io/web.rs` (+1/-1)
**Change**: Simplified reference to meta path function
```rust
// Before:
/// See [`crate::io::get_meta_path`]

// After:

// After:
/// the operations are performed in [`Hsla`](`crate::Hsla`).
```

### `crates/bevy_picking/src/lib.rs` (+1/-1)
**Change**: Improved pointer hits documentation reference
```rust
// Before:
/// into a [`crate::backend::PointerHits`]

// After:
/// into a [`PointerHits`](`crate::backend::PointerHits`)
```

### `crates/bevy_picking/src/pointer.rs` (+1/-1)
**Change**: Cleaned up input module reference
```rust
