## Description Translation
# Objective

- `weak_handle` macro causes ``error: cannot find macro `uuid_handle` in this scope``.

## Solution

- Add `$crate::` prefix to `uuid_handle!`.

## Testing

- Compiling usage of `weak_handle` with this change

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a straightforward but important macro scoping issue in Bevy's asset handling system. The problem occurred when developers used the `weak_handle` macro, which would fail to compile with the error "cannot find macro `uuid_handle` in this scope."

The root cause was that the `weak_handle` macro was trying to call the `uuid_handle` macro without specifying its full path. In Rust, macros need explicit path qualification when they're called from outside their defining module. Without the `$crate::` prefix, the compiler couldn't locate the `uuid_handle` macro when `weak_handle` was used in different contexts.

The solution was simple but effective: adding `$crate::` before the `uuid_handle!` call within the `weak_handle` macro definition. This ensures that the macro always resolves to the correct path within the current crate, regardless of where `weak_handle` is invoked from.

This fix follows Rust's best practices for macro design, where internal macro calls should use `$crate::` to ensure proper scoping and avoid import issues. The change is minimal but crucial for maintaining the usability of Bevy's asset system macros across different modules and contexts.

    end
```

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_asset/src/handle.rs` (+1/-1)

This file contains the macro definitions for asset handle generation. The change ensures proper macro path resolution.

**Before:**
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! weak_handle {
    ($uuid:expr) => {
        uuid_handle!($uuid)
    };
}
```

**After:**
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! weak_handle {
    ($uuid:expr) => {
        $crate::uuid_handle!($uuid)
    };
}
```

The change adds the `$crate::` prefix to the `uuid_handle!` macro call, ensuring it resolves correctly regardless of where `weak_handle` is used.
