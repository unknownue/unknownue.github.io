## Description Translation
# Objective

We don't normally use the `spawned_at` naming convention in Bevy  (with `spawned_at_TICK` being implied). `spawned_at` violates that convention.

## Solution

Rename `spawned_at` to `spawn_tick`, and all associated getter + internals. I've done the release notes update in my current editorial pass.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a naming inconsistency in Bevy's ECS (Entity Component System) codebase. The issue was straightforward but widespread: the codebase used `spawned_at` for tick-related fields and methods, which violated Bevy's established naming convention where tick-related identifiers should use the `_tick` suffix pattern.

The problem originated in the `SpawnDetails` struct and related entity management code. While most tick-related fields in Bevy follow the pattern `*_tick` (like `change_tick`, `last_run_tick`, etc.), the `spawned_at` field stood out as an exception. This inconsistency made the codebase less predictable and increased cognitive load for developers working with these APIs.

The solution was a systematic renaming operation across multiple ECS modules. The developer renamed:
- The `spawned_at` field to `spawn_tick` in the `SpawnDetails` struct
- The `spawned_at()` method to `spawn_tick()` in multiple accessor interfaces
- Internal variable names and method parameters to maintain consistency
- The `entity_get_spawned_or_despawned_at()` method to `entity_get_spawn_or_despawn_tick()`

The implementation required changes across seven files in the ECS crate, touching entity management, query fetching, command systems, and world access interfaces. Each change was mechanical but necessary to maintain consistency throughout the codebase.

From a technical perspective, this change demonstrates Bevy's commitment to consistent API design. The `Tick` type represents a specific point in the ECS timeline, and using consistent naming helps developers quickly understand what each field represents. The `_tick` suffix immediately communicates that the value relates to the tick system rather than some other temporal measurement.

The impact of this change is primarily on code quality and developer experience. While it doesn't alter functionality, it makes the codebase more consistent and predictable. Developers can now expect that all tick-related fields and methods will follow the same naming pattern, reducing mental overhead when working with these APIs.

One interesting technical aspect is how the change propagates through the system. The core data structure `SpawnedOrDespawned` stores the tick value, and this value flows through multiple layers of abstraction:
- From the internal entity metadata storage
- Through the `Entities` resource methods
- To the public-facing `EntityRef` and `EntityMut` interfaces
- Finally to the `SpawnDetails` queryable component

This renaming ensures consistency across all these layers, making the system more coherent and easier to understand.

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/entity/mod.rs** (+13/-13)
This file contains the core entity metadata management. The changes renamed the `at` parameter to `tick` in multiple methods and updated the `SpawnedOrDespawned` struct field from `at` to `tick`.

```rust
// Before:
struct SpawnedOrDespawned {
    by: MaybeLocation,
    at: Tick,
}

// After:
struct SpawnedOrDespawned {
    by: MaybeLocation,
    tick: Tick,
}
```

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/query/fetch.rs** (+7/-7)
This file defines the `SpawnDetails` queryable component. The field and method were renamed from `spawned_at` to `spawn_tick`.

```rust
// Before:
pub struct SpawnDetails {
    spawned_by: MaybeLocation,
    spawned_at: Tick,
    // ...
}
pub fn spawned_at(self) -> Tick {
    self.spawned_at
}

// After:
pub struct SpawnDetails {
    spawned_by: MaybeLocation,
    spawn_tick: Tick,
    // ...
}
pub fn spawn_tick(self) -> Tick {
    self.spawn_tick
}
```

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/world/entity_ref.rs** (+15/-15)
This file contains various entity reference types. All `spawned_at()` methods were renamed to `spawn_tick()`.

```rust
// Before:
pub fn spawned_at(&self) -> Tick {
    self.cell.spawned_at()
}

// After:
pub fn spawn_tick(&self) -> Tick {
    self.cell.spawn_tick()
}
```

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/world/mod.rs** (+4/-4)
World tests were updated to use the new method name `entity_get_spawn_or_despawn_tick()` instead of `entity_get_spawned_or_despawned_at()`.

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/commands/mod.rs** (+1/-1)
Command tests were updated to use the new method name.
