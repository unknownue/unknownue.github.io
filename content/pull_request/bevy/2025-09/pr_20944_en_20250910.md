## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a naming inconsistency in Bevy's UI widget system. The original naming scheme used `Core` as a prefix for headless widget components (e.g., `CoreButton`, `CoreSlider`), but this created confusion about whether these were core engine components or just unstyled widgets. The solution was to rename the crate from `bevy_core_widgets` to `bevy_ui_widgets` and remove the `Core` prefix from all component names.

The problem was straightforward: the `Core` prefix suggested these were fundamental engine components when they were actually just unstyled UI widgets. This naming mismatch could mislead developers about their purpose and importance in the architecture. The fix involved a systematic renaming across the entire codebase to align the names with their actual function.

The implementation required changes across multiple areas:
1. Renaming the crate itself and updating all dependency references
2. Renaming component structs (e.g., `CoreButton` → `Button`)
3. Updating plugin names (e.g., `CoreButtonPlugin` → `ButtonPlugin`)
4. Modifying examples and documentation to reflect the new naming
5. Updating release notes to document the change

The technical approach was methodical but mechanical - each occurrence of the old naming pattern needed to be identified and updated. The changes were mostly straightforward substitutions, but required care to ensure all references were updated consistently.

The impact of these changes is primarily improved clarity for developers. The new names more accurately reflect that these are standard UI widgets rather than core engine components. This aligns with Bevy's modular architecture where UI widgets are optional components rather than fundamental engine parts.

The changes also included renaming example files from `core_widgets` to `standard_widgets` to further emphasize that these are standard UI components rather than core engine functionality.
