## Description Translation
# Objective

Add documentation for the last two functions in bevy_picking that are missing them.

## Solution

Add boilerplate "Constructs an X" to `PointerHits::new()` and `HitData::new()`.

This form of no-information documentation of `new()` functions is used in several places in the repo, and @alice-i-cecile agreed that this is a reasonable approach - the params are already documented on the fields within the struct definition.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a documentation gap in Bevy's picking system by adding minimal but essential doc comments to two constructor methods. While working on the bevy_picking module, the author identified that `PointerHits::new` and `HitData::new` were the last remaining functions in the module without any documentation. This lack of documentation violated the project's standards and could lead to confusion for developers interacting with these APIs.

The solution follows existing patterns in the codebase for documenting constructor methods. Both structs already had documentation for their fields, so the team decided that simple boilerplate comments would be sufficient. This approach maintains consistency with other similar constructors while avoiding redundant documentation. The key engineering decision here was to balance completeness with maintainability - by relying on existing field documentation, the changes keep the codebase DRY while still meeting documentation requirements.

The implementation involved straightforward modifications to the method signatures. The previous `#[expect(missing_docs)]` attribute was removed and replaced with standard doc comments. For example:

```rust
// Before:
#[expect(missing_docs, reason = "Not all docs are written yet, see #3492.")]
pub fn new(...) -> Self

// After:
/// Construct [`PointerHits`]
pub fn new(...) -> Self
```

This change completes the documentation coverage for the bevy_picking module while maintaining consistency with the project's established patterns. The minimal documentation style was chosen because:
1. The parameters are already documented in the struct fields
2. The constructor patterns are straightforward and follow conventional Rust idioms
3. More verbose documentation would provide diminishing returns given the simple nature of these constructors

The impact is immediately visible in the generated documentation, where these methods now show clear purpose statements. This improves the developer experience by making the API more discoverable and self-documenting, particularly for newcomers to the codebase.

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_picking/src/backend.rs** (+2/-2)
- Updated documentation for two constructor methods to meet project standards

Code changes:
```rust
// PointerHits implementation before
#[expect(missing_docs, reason = "Not all docs are written yet, see #3492.")]
pub fn new(pointer: prelude::PointerId, picks: Vec<(Entity, HitData)>, order: f32) -> Self

// After
/// Construct [`PointerHits`]
pub fn new(pointer: prelude::PointerId, picks: Vec<(Entity, HitData)>, order: f32) -> Self

// HitData implementation before
#[expect(missing_docs, reason = "Not all docs are written yet, see #3492.")]
pub fn new(camera: Entity, depth: f32, position: Option<Vec3>, normal: Option<Vec3>) -> Self

// After
/// Construct a [`HitData`]
pub fn new(camera: Entity, depth: f32, position: Option<Vec3>, normal: Option<Vec3>) -> Self
```
