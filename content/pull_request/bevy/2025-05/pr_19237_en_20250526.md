## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
Bevy's windowing system lacked support for creating initially unfocused windows, despite having a `focused` property in its `Window` struct. This created a discrepancy between Bevy's API surface and the underlying winit capabilities. The core issue was that while users could set `Window::focused` to `false`, this setting wasn't actually respected during window creation on supported platforms.

### The Solution Approach
The implementation leverages winit's `WindowBuilder::with_active` method to control initial focus state. This approach directly maps Bevy's `Window::focused` property to winit's window activation mechanism. The developer considered potential platform compatibility issues, particularly noting that some platforms (like Linux/X11/Wayland) don't support this feature, but concluded this was acceptable given Bevy's existing platform support matrix.

### The Implementation
The key change occurs in the window creation process where the winit builder is configured:

```rust
// In crates/bevy_winit/src/winit_windows.rs
window_builder
    .with_transparent(window.transparent)
    .with_active(window.focused);  // New line added
```

This single-line addition connects Bevy's `focused` property to winit's activation control. The developer also enhanced documentation to clarify platform-specific behaviors:

```rust
// In crates/bevy_window/src/window.rs
/// Get/set whether the window is focused.
///
/// It cannot be set unfocused after creation.
///
/// ## Platform-specific
///
/// - iOS / Android / X11 / Wayland: Spawning unfocused is
///   [not supported](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/window/struct.WindowAttributes.html#method.with_active).
/// - iOS / Android / Web / Wayland: Setting focused after creation is
///   [not supported](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/window/struct.Window.html#method.focus_window).
pub focused: bool,
```

### Technical Insights
The implementation demonstrates proper abstraction layering by:
1. Maintaining Bevy's platform-agnostic `Window` API
2. Delegating platform-specific implementation details to winit
3. Providing clear documentation about platform limitations

The developer considered adding synchronization logic between Bevy's window state and winit's actual focus state but validated through testing that this wasn't necessary on unsupported platforms.

### The Impact
This change enables new use cases like:
- Creating background windows for tooling/utilities
- Implementing non-interruptive overlay displays
- Multi-window setups with controlled focus behavior

The 11-day review cycle and straightforward implementation suggest this was a well-scoped improvement that filled a clear gap in Bevy's windowing capabilities without introducing significant complexity.

## Visual Representation

```mermaid
graph TD
    BevyWindow[Window Component] -->|focused: bool| WinitBuilder
    WinitBuilder[winit::WindowBuilder] -->|with_active()| PlatformWindow
```

## Key Files Changed

1. `crates/bevy_winit/src/winit_windows.rs`
```rust
// Modified window builder configuration
.with_transparent(window.transparent)
.with_active(window.focused);  // Added activation control
```
This connects Bevy's window configuration to winit's activation API.

2. `crates/bevy_window/src/window.rs`
```rust
// Added documentation block
/// ## Platform-specific
///
/// - iOS / Android / X11 / Wayland: Spawning unfocused is
///   [not supported](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/window/struct.WindowAttributes.html#method.with-active).
/// - iOS / Android / Web / Wayland: Setting focused after creation is
///   [not supported](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/window/struct.Window.html#method.focus_window).
pub focused: bool,
```
This provides crucial platform compatibility information to users.
