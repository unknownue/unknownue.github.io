## Description Translation

similar to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12030

# Objective

`bevy_mod_debugdump` uses the `SystemTypeSet::system_type` to look up constrains like `(system_1, system_2.after(system_1))`. For that it needs to find the type id in `schedule.graph().systems()`

Now with systems being wrapped in an `InfallibleSystemWrapper` this association was no longer possible.

## Solution

By forwarding the type id in `InfallibleSystemWrapper`, `bevy_mod_debugdump` can resolve the dependencies as before, and the wrapper is an unnoticable implementation detail.

## Testing

- `cargo test -p bevy_ecs`
I'm not sure what exactly could break otherwise.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The problem emerged when systems started being wrapped in `InfallibleSystemWrapper`, which broke `bevy_mod_debugdump`'s ability to analyze system dependencies. The debug tool relied on accessing each system's TypeId through `SystemTypeSet::system_type` to determine ordering constraints like `system_2.after(system_1)`. The wrapper effectively hid the original system's type information, preventing proper dependency resolution.

The solution followed established patterns from previous similar fixes. The key insight was that `InfallibleSystemWrapper` needed to transparently expose the wrapped system's TypeId. This required implementing the `type_id` method in the wrapper's System trait implementation, directly forwarding to the inner system's `type_id`.

The implementation was surgically precise. A single method was added to the `InfallibleSystemWrapper`'s System trait impl:

```rust
fn type_id(&self) -> core::any::TypeId {
    self.0.type_id()
}
```

This four-line change preserved the wrapper's transparency for type identification while maintaining all other encapsulation. The approach mirrored PR #12030's solution for similar wrapper types, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

The change's impact was significant for development tools while being negligible for runtime execution. By preserving TypeId access through the wrapper:
1. Debugging tools could continue analyzing system graphs accurately
2. The wrapper remained an implementation detail without affecting dependent code
3. System constraints visualization worked as intended

This fix demonstrates the importance of maintaining type transparency in wrapper patterns, particularly when type metadata is used for debugging and analysis tools. It also highlights the value of consistent patterns across similar components - by following the established solution from PR #12030, the fix was both efficient and low-risk.

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/schedule_system.rs** (+4/-0)

Added the `type_id` method to `InfallibleSystemWrapper`'s System trait implementation:

```rust
// Before: Missing type_id implementation
impl<S: System<In = ()>> System for InfallibleSystemWrapper<S> {
    // Existing methods...
}

// After:
impl<S: System<In = ()>> System for InfallibleSystemWrapper<S> {
    // ... existing methods
    
    fn type_id(&self) -> core::any::TypeId {
        self.0.type_id()
    }
    
    // ... remaining methods
}
```

This change allows the wrapper to expose the inner system's TypeId, crucial for maintaining debug tool functionality while preserving encapsulation.
