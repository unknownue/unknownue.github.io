## Description Translation

# Objective

In #19253 we pinned nightly due to a bug in Miri. That issue was resolved and the latest Miri should be usable for us again.

## Solution

- Use latest nightly again

## Testing

- I tested today's Miri locally with `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=nightly-2025-05-18 MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-ignore-leaks -Zmiri-disable-isolation" RUSTFLAGS="-Zrandomize-layout" cargo miri test -p bevy_ecs`


## The Story of This Pull Request

The Bevy project's CI pipeline temporarily pinned a specific Rust nightly version (2025-05-16) as a workaround for Miri test failures caused by rust-lang/miri#4323. This PR removes that temporary constraint after verifying the upstream fix.

**The Problem**: Nightly Rust toolchain updates occasionally introduce breaking changes. In this case, a Miri bug (#4323) caused test failures in Bevy's CI pipeline. To maintain CI stability while waiting for a Miri fix, the team pinned to a known-good nightly version.

**The Solution**: After the Miri maintainers resolved the issue, this PR updates the CI configuration to resume using the latest nightly. The author validated the fix by:
1. Testing locally with the newer nightly-2025-05-18
2. Using Miri's test flags (`-Zmiri-ignore-leaks`, `-Zmiri-disable-isolation`)
3. Maintaining randomized layout testing (`-Zrandomize-layout`)

**Implementation Details**: The core change modifies a single environment variable in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# Before:
NIGHTLY_TOOLCHAIN: nightly-2025-05-16

# After:
NIGHTLY_TOOLCHAIN: nightly
```

This change allows automatic adoption of new nightly builds while maintaining test reliability. The comment explicitly documents the pinning pattern for future maintenance.

**Technical Trade-offs**:
- Pro: Reduces maintenance overhead by eliminating manual nightly updates
- Pro: Ensures timely detection of new Rust compiler issues
- Con: Risks transient CI failures from new nightly regressions

**Impact**: Restores normal CI behavior while maintaining test coverage through Miri-based memory safety checks. The approach demonstrates effective CI maintenance patterns - temporary pinning followed by prompt unpinning after upstream fixes.

## Key Files Changed

**.github/workflows/ci.yml** (+1/-1)
```yaml
# Before:
NIGHTLY_TOOLCHAIN: nightly-2025-05-16 # pinned until a fix for...

# After:
NIGHTLY_TOOLCHAIN: nightly
```

This single-line change:
1. Removes the date-specific nightly pin
2. Restores automatic use of the latest nightly
3. Maintains documentation about the pinning pattern
