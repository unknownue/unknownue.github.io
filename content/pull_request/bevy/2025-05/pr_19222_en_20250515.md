## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses CI failures caused by new Clippy lint warnings introduced in Rust toolchain updates. The primary focus was handling the `clippy::large_enum_variant` warnings while maintaining existing functionality. The changes demonstrate a pattern of consciously acknowledging lint warnings when immediate resolution isn't feasible.

The core issue stemmed from enum definitions containing variants with significantly different memory footprints. While Clippy's warning about large enum variants is generally valid (as enum size is determined by its largest variant), there are legitimate cases where this pattern is necessary for performance or architectural reasons.

The solution employed `#[expect]` attributes to explicitly acknowledge the lints while preserving CI stability. This approach serves two purposes:
1. Documents the conscious decision to keep the current structure
2. Maintains visibility for future improvements through the linked issue (#19220)

Key technical decisions included:
- Using `#[expect(clippy::large_enum_variant)]` instead of `#[allow]` to:
  - Track outstanding lint warnings
  - Enable automatic warning suppression when the underlying issue is resolved
- Maintaining all enum implementations unchanged to avoid introducing breaking changes
- Addressing minor Clippy suggestions in unrelated areas through simple refactors

The implementation affected multiple components across the rendering system, particularly in pipeline management and resource allocation. For example, in `pipeline_cache.rs`, several critical enums received expectations:

```rust
#[expect(
    clippy::large_enum_variant,
    reason = "See https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19220"
)]
pub enum CachedPipelineState {
    Queued,
    Ok(Pipeline),
    Err(PipelineCacheError),
}
```

This pattern appears consistently across modified files, demonstrating a systematic approach to handling the lint warnings without altering business logic.

## Key Files Changed

1. **crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/pipeline_cache.rs**
   - Added expectations for large enum variants and result size
   - Preserved existing pipeline state management logic
   ```rust
   #[expect(clippy::large_enum_variant, reason = "...")]
   pub enum CachedPipelineState { ... }
   ```

2. **crates/bevy_text/src/pipeline.rs**
   - Simplified attribute builder pattern
   - Before:
   ```rust
   let attrs = Attrs::new()...;
   attrs
   ```
   - After:
   ```rust
   Attrs::new()...
   ```

3. **crates/bevy_render/src/batching/gpu_preprocessing.rs**
   - Acknowledged large enum variant in rendering work items
   ```rust
   #[expect(clippy::large_enum_variant, reason = "...")]
   pub enum PreprocessWorkItemBuffers { ... }
   ```
