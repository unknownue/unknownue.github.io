## Description Translation
# Objective

It can be useful to store the `SystemChangeTick` for a given System. I wanted to copy them but I noticed that it doesn't implement Clone.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The need arose when a developer working with Bevy's ECS system wanted to store `SystemChangeTick` instances for later use or comparison. `SystemChangeTick` is crucial for change detection in systems, tracking two important values:
- `last_run`: The tick count from the previous system execution
- `this_run`: The current tick count

The core problem was straightforward: while trying to copy these ticks for diagnostic or tracking purposes, the developer discovered the struct didn't implement `Clone`. This prevented simple duplication of the tick data through conventional means like `.clone()` or assignment.

The solution was surgically precise. The implementation modified the derive macro for `SystemChangeTick` to include both `Clone` and `Copy` traits:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct SystemChangeTick {
    last_run: Tick,
    this_run: Tick,
}
```

This change works because:
1. The underlying `Tick` type (used by both fields) already implements `Copy`
2. Adding `Clone` is safe as it's automatically derived for types containing `Clone` fields
3. `Copy` derivation follows naturally since the struct contains only `Copy` fields

The technical decision to include both traits was intentional:
- `Clone` enables explicit cloning when needed
- `Copy` allows implicit copying through simple assignment
- Both traits work together to provide flexibility without runtime cost

From an architectural perspective, this change maintains all existing invariants of the ECS system while expanding usability. Since `SystemChangeTick` is a simple data container without ownership semantics, adding copy semantics doesn't introduce any risks of misuse.

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/system_param.rs** (+1/-1)
```rust
// Before:
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct SystemChangeTick {
    last_run: Tick,
    this_run: Tick,
}

// After:
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct SystemChangeTick {
    last_run: Tick,
    this_run: Tick,
}
```

This single-line change enables cloning and copying of system change ticks while maintaining all existing functionality. The modification directly addresses the core issue by adding the missing trait implementations.
