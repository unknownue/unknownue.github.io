## Description Translation
This PR adds missing punctuation to doc comments in the `Image` struct. No functional changes - pure documentation improvement.

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
While working with Bevy's image handling code, the author noticed inconsistent punctuation in documentation comments for the `Image` struct. Specifically:
1. The `data` field's comments lacked terminal periods
2. A TODO comment was missing proper punctuation

Though minor, these inconsistencies affected:
- Codebase hygiene
- Documentation clarity
- Contributor experience when reading struct definitions

### The Solution Approach
The developer implemented a surgical fix targeting three specific locations:
1. Added terminal period to first `data` field comment
2. Added terminal period to second `data` field comment
3. Added terminal period to TODO comment

No alternatives were needed as this was a straightforward punctuation correction without technical tradeoffs.

### The Implementation
The changes focused exclusively on comment formatting in `image.rs`:

```rust
// Before:
/// If the image is being used as a storage texture which doesn't need to be initialized by the
/// CPU, then this should be `None`
/// Otherwise, it should always be `Some`

// After:
/// If the image is being used as a storage texture which doesn't need to be initialized by the
/// CPU, then this should be `None`.
/// Otherwise, it should always be `Some`.
```

```rust
// Before:
// TODO: this nesting makes accessing Image metadata verbose...

// After: 
// TODO: this nesting makes accessing Image metadata verbose...
```

### Technical Insights
While seemingly trivial, these changes:
- Align with Rust API documentation conventions
- Improve auto-generated documentation consistency
- Follow Bevy's style guide for comments
- Make documentation more professional and readable

### The Impact
This PR:
- Raises code quality standards through attention to detail
- Makes documentation more approachable for new contributors
- Maintains Bevy's reputation for clean, well-documented code
- Takes 30 seconds to review but provides lasting readability benefits
