## Description Translation
The original description is in English and preserved as-is:

# Objective
Avoid needing to compile `taplo-cli` every time we use it in CI.

## Solution
Use [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install `taplo-cli`.

cargo-binstall is different from `cargo install`, in that it will first attempt download a precompiled `taplo-cli` binary, in an attempt to avoid compilation. However, failing that (for any reason), it will fall back to installing the binary through `cargo install`.

While installing `taplo-cli` from source is relatively fast (around 50-60s), this still provides a small speed boost to the job, by not needing to spend time compiling `taplo-cli` from source at all.

## Note on how this affects workflows
This PR does have one side-effect: Should `taplo-cli` need to be compiled from source at all, it is no longer guaranteed to use the latest `stable` version of `rustc`. This may be considered problematic, as `taplo-cli` doesn't appear to have a MSRV policy.

However, its MSRV (as of writing this PR) is `1.74` - a nearly 1.5 year old version. This seems to imply that, if `taplo-cli`'s MSRV is ever updated, it won't be to the absolute latest stable version of Rust until said version is a few months old.

Combine that with [the Github Actions runner images being frequently (and automatically) updated to use the latest Rust tooling](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/pull/11957), and I don't foresee `taplo-cli`'s MSRV being an issue in 99% of circumstances.

Still, there is the possibility of it being a problem in those 1% of circumstances - if this is a concern, please let me know and I'll try to fix it.

## Testing

This change was tested on my local fork. The specific job run can be found [here](https://github.com/LikeLakers2/bevy/actions/runs/14350945588/job/40229485624).

## The Story of This Pull Request

The CI pipeline for Bevy's TOML formatting check had a minor inefficiency: each run compiled the taplo-cli tool from source using `cargo install`. While the compilation time of 50-60 seconds wasn't catastrophic, it represented an optimization opportunity in a frequently-run workflow.

The solution centered around cargo-binstall, a Rust binary installer that prioritizes prebuilt binaries. The implementation required two key changes to the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Toolchain Setup**:
   - Replaced `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` with `cargo-bins/cargo-binstall@v1.12.3`
   - Added `BINSTALL_VERSION` environment variable to pin the installer version

2. **Installation Command**:
   ```yaml
   - run: cargo binstall taplo-cli@0.9.3 --locked
   ```
   This command attempts to download a precompiled binary first, only falling back to source compilation if necessary.

The technical trade-off involves potential MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) mismatches if source compilation becomes necessary. However, the analysis showed:
- taplo-cli's current MSRV (1.74) was significantly older than CI's Rust version
- GitHub's runner images keep Rust toolchains updated
- Fallback scenarios would only occur with incompatible binaries, which are rare

Testing demonstrated successful execution in a real CI environment ([job 40229485624](https://github.com/LikeLakers2/bevy/actions/runs/14350945588/job/40229485624)), validating the approach without requiring additional test coverage.

## Key Files Changed

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (+3/-2)
**Purpose**: Optimize taplo-cli installation in CI

Before:
```yaml
- uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
- name: Install taplo
  run: cargo install taplo-cli --locked
```

After:
```yaml
- uses: cargo-bins/cargo-binstall@v1.12.3
- name: Install taplo
  run: cargo binstall taplo-cli@0.9.3 --locked
```

The changes replace the standard Rust toolchain setup with cargo-binstall's action and modify the installation command to use binary installation first.
