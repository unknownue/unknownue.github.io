## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses routine maintenance of the project's code quality tools by updating the crate-ci/typos GitHub Action from version 1.31.1 to 1.32.0. The typos checker serves as a critical first line of defense against spelling mistakes in code comments and documentation, which can impact code readability and API discoverability.

The update introduced improved pattern matching in the typos tool, which subsequently identified several previously undetected spelling errors in the codebase. The developer addressed these findings through targeted corrections in comments across multiple repositories:

1. **CI Pipeline Update**: The core change updates the GitHub Actions workflow to use the new typos version:
```yaml
# Before:
uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.31.1

# After: 
uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.32.0
```
This version bump triggers the updated spelling checks in all subsequent CI runs.

2. **Typo Corrections**: The updated linter identified four spelling errors:
- `vertice` → `vertex` in mesh intersection benchmarks
- `regisered` → `registered` in component documentation
- `obserer` → `observer` in observer system comments

These corrections demonstrate the value of maintaining updated linters, as newer versions can detect patterns that older versions missed. The changes are localized to comments and documentation strings, preserving existing functionality while improving code clarity.

The technical approach follows standard dependency update practices: verify compatibility, update version references, and address any new warnings generated by the updated tool. No architectural changes were required since the typos checker operates as a separate linting step in the CI pipeline.

## Key Files Changed

1. **CI Configuration**
```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
-        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.31.1
+        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.32.0
```
Updates the linter version in CI pipeline

2. **Benchmark Comment Fix**
```rust
// File: benches/bevy_picking/ray_mesh_intersection.rs
-        // Push a new vertice to the mesh...
+        // Push a new vertex to the mesh...
```
Corrects singular/plural noun usage

3. **Component Documentation**
```rust
// File: crates/bevy_ecs/src/component.rs
-    /// This will return `None` only if the id is neither regisered...
+    /// This will return `None` only if the id is neither registered...
```
Fixes repeated spelling error in API docs

4. **Observer System Comment**
```rust
// File: crates/bevy_ecs/src/observer/mod.rs
-    /// The location of the source code that triggered the obserer.
+    /// The location of the source code that triggered the observer.
```
Corrects transposed letters in noun
