## Description Translation
# Objective

`RelatedSpawnerCommands` offers methods to get the underlying `Commands`.
`RelatedSpawner` does not expose the inner `World` reference so far.

I currently want to write extension traits for both of them but I need to duplicate the whole API for the latter because I cannot get it's `&mut World`.

## Solution

Add methods for immutable and mutable `World` access

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a API completeness issue in Bevy's ECS relationship handling. The core problem stemmed from an asymmetry between `RelatedSpawnerCommands` and `RelatedSpawner` types in their access to fundamental ECS resources. While `RelatedSpawnerCommands` provided direct access to `Commands`, its counterpart `RelatedSpawner` lacked equivalent access to the `World` reference it contained.

This limitation became apparent when attempting to create extension traits that needed to operate on both types. Without direct `World` access through `RelatedSpawner`, developers faced two undesirable options:
1. Duplicate existing API surfaces unnecessarily
2. Work around the limitation through indirect access patterns

The solution implemented follows Rust's standard borrowing patterns by adding two straightforward accessor methods to the `RelatedSpawner` struct:
```rust
pub fn world(&self) -> &World {
    self.world
}

pub fn world_mut(&mut self) -> &mut World {
    self.world
}
```
These methods align with common Rust API design practices for structs containing resources, following the principle of "make illegal states unrepresentable" by providing controlled access to internal state.

The implementation required no architectural changes, as `RelatedSpawner` already contained the `world` field as a mutable reference (`&'w mut World`). The new methods simply expose this existing reference through standard accessor patterns, maintaining consistency with Rust's ownership system.

Key technical considerations included:
1. Maintaining borrow checker safety through proper reference lifetimes
2. Preserving existing encapsulation boundaries
3. Matching API patterns established in other parts of Bevy's ECS system

The changes directly enable new use cases for `RelatedSpawner` by allowing systems to:
- Read component data directly from the World
- Query entity relationships
- Perform complex entity operations through the World API
Without requiring workarounds or duplicate trait implementations.

## Visual Representation

```mermaid
graph TD
    RS[RelatedSpawner] -->|world()| W[World]
    RS -->|world_mut()| W
    W --> EC[Entity Component System]
    W --> CM[Commands]
```

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/relationship/related_methods.rs** (+10/-0)

Added two methods to expose World access:
```rust
// Before:
impl<'w, R: Relationship> RelatedSpawner<'w, R> {
    // Existing methods without World access
}

// After:
impl<'w, R: Relationship> RelatedSpawner<'w, R> {
    // ...

    pub fn world(&self) -> &World {
        self.world
    }

    pub fn world_mut(&mut self) -> &mut World {
        self.world
    }
}
```

These changes complete the API surface for `RelatedSpawner` by providing fundamental access to its contained World reference, matching patterns used elsewhere in Bevy's ECS system.
