## The Story of This Pull Request

The problem stemmed from an incorrect calculation in Bevy's physically based rendering (PBR) implementation when handling lights whose radius overlapped with mesh surfaces. This manifested as harsh specular cutoffs (#13318), particularly noticeable when objects intersected a light's spherical influence area. The root cause lay in how the rendering system computed the closest point between the light sphere and reflection rays.

In the original implementation, the calculation for `centerToRay` used an unclamped dot product between the light-to-fragment vector (`light_to_frag`) and the reflection vector (`R`). This could produce negative values when the surface point was inside or near the light's radius, leading to a miscalculation of the closest point on the light sphere to the reflection ray. The negative dot product caused the algorithm to select a point behind the ray origin rather than along the ray direction, creating visual discontinuities.

The solution involved modifying the shader code in `pbr_lighting.wgsl` to clamp this critical dot product to a small positive value (0.0001). Here's the key code change:

```wgsl
// Before
let centerToRay = dot(light_to_frag, R) * R - light_to_frag;

// After
var LtFdotR = dot(light_to_frag, R);
LtFdotR = max(0.0001, LtFdotR);
let centerToRay = LtFdotR * R - light_to_frag;
```

This clamping ensures the calculation always uses a point along the reflection ray's forward direction, preventing the selection of invalid points behind the ray origin. The 0.0001 threshold was chosen as a practical minimum to avoid division-by-zero errors while maintaining numerical stability.

The implementation preserves the existing representative point area light approximation from Epic's PBR notes but adds this crucial safeguard. The comments in the code acknowledge this as a temporary fix, noting that more accurate solutions like those from recent SIGGRAPH papers could provide better long-term results. However, this minimal change effectively addresses the immediate visual artifact without introducing significant performance overhead.

```

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_pbr/src/render/pbr_lighting.wgsl** (+17/-1)

This WGSL shader file contains the core lighting calculations. The modification addresses a discontinuity in specular highlights when meshes intersect light spheres.

Before:
```wgsl
let centerToRay = dot(light_to_frag, R) * R - light_to_frag;
```

After:
```wgsl
var LtFdotR = dot(light_to_frag, R);
LtFdotR = max(0.0001, LtFdotR);
let centerToRay = LtFdotR * R - light_to_frag;
```

The changes ensure the dot product used in the closest-point calculation remains positive, preventing invalid backward projections that caused visual artifacts.
