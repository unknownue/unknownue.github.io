# Title: Strip unused features from `bevy_asset` dependencies

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
The `bevy_asset` crate carried unnecessary dependency features that increased build times and binary size. This technical debt became more apparent when preparing for potential `no_std` support (#18978), where extraneous features could complicate the transition. A specific compilation error existed when enabling the `file_watcher` feature without `multi_threaded`, enforced through a `compile_error!` macro.

### The Solution Approach
The author implemented a two-pronged strategy:
1. **Dependency feature pruning**: Disabled default features for all dependencies, explicitly enabling only required features
2. **Feature dependency resolution**: Modified the `file_watcher` feature to automatically enable `multi_threaded`, resolving the compilation error at the feature declaration level rather than through runtime checks

### The Implementation
The core changes appear in `Cargo.toml`, with strategic dependency modifications:

```toml
# Before:
bevy_app = { path = "../bevy_app", version = "0.16.0-dev" }

# After:
bevy_app = { 
  path = "../bevy_app", 
  version = "0.16.0-dev", 
  default-features = false, 
  features = ["bevy_reflect"]
}
```
This pattern repeats across all dependencies, ensuring each only pulls necessary features. The `file_watcher` feature definition changed to include its actual dependency:
```toml
[features]
-file_watcher = ["notify-debouncer-full", "watch"]
+file_watcher = ["notify-debouncer-full", "watch", "multi_threaded"]
```

### Technical Insights
Key implementation details include:
1. **Feature propagation**: Ensuring parent features (like `file_watcher`) properly declare their dependencies
2. **Cross-platform consistency**: Maintaining platform-specific dependencies while stripping defaults
3. **Error prevention**: Removing the `compile_error!` check in `lib.rs` since the feature dependency tree now enforces correct configuration

### The Impact
1. **Reduced build overhead**: Eliminating unused features decreases compile times and final binary size
2. **Cleaner feature graph**: Explicit dependencies prevent unexpected feature interactions
3. **Foundation for future work**: Prepares for `no_std` support by removing implicit std dependencies through default features

## Key Files Changed

1. **crates/bevy_asset/Cargo.toml**
```toml
# Before general dependency pattern:
bevy_app = { path = "../bevy_app", version = "0.16.0-dev" }

# After:
bevy_app = { 
  path = "../bevy_app", 
  version = "0.16.0-dev", 
  default-features = false, 
  features = ["bevy_reflect"]
}

# Feature dependency resolution:
-file_watcher = ["notify-debouncer-full", "watch"]
+file_watcher = ["notify-debouncer-full", "watch", "multi_threaded"]
```

2. **crates/bevy_asset/src/lib.rs**
```rust
# Removed compile-time check:
-#[cfg(all(feature = "file_watcher", not(feature = "multi_threaded")))]
-compile_error!("...");
```
