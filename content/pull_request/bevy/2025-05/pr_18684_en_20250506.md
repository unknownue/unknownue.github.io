## Description Translation
The original description is in English and preserved as-is:

# Objective

Simplify code in the `SingleThreadedExecutor` by removing a special case for exclusive systems.  

The `SingleThreadedExecutor` runs systems without immediately applying deferred buffers.  That required calling `run_unsafe()` instead of `run()`, but that would `panic` for exclusive systems, so the code also needed a special case for those.  Following #18076 and #18406, we have a `run_without_applying_deferred` method that has the exact behavior we want and works on exclusive systems.  

## Solution

Replace the code in `SingleThreadedExecutor` that runs systems with a single call to `run_without_applying_deferred()`.  Also add this as a wrapper in the `__rust_begin_short_backtrace` module to preserve the special behavior for backtraces.  

## The Story of This Pull Request

The SingleThreadedExecutor faced a maintenance challenge due to divergent handling of exclusive and non-exclusive systems. Prior implementations required unsafe code blocks and conditional logic to manage deferred system buffers - temporary storage for batched component modifications. The executor needed to run systems without immediately applying these buffers, but existing methods either panicked for exclusive systems or required unsafe operations.

This situation emerged because:
1. Exclusive systems require direct mutable World access
2. Non-exclusive systems typically use deferred buffers
3. The previous `run_unsafe` method wasn't compatible with exclusive systems

The solution became possible after two foundational PRs (#18076, #18406) introduced `run_without_applying_deferred` - a unified method that works for both system types while delaying buffer application. This PR leverages that API to eliminate special-case handling.

Key implementation changes occurred in two files:
1. **executor/mod.rs**: Added the new wrapper function to maintain backtrace visibility
2. **executor/single_threaded.rs**: Replaced conditional execution logic with a single method call

Before this change, the executor contained complex branching:
```rust
if system.is_exclusive() {
    // Use safe run() with immediate buffer application
    __rust_begin_short_backtrace::run(system, world)
} else {
    // Use unsafe run_unsafe() without buffer application
    let world = world.as_unsafe_world_cell();
    unsafe { __rust_begin_short_backtrace::run_unsafe(system, world) }
}
```

The updated implementation collapses this to:
```rust
__rust_begin_short_backtrace::run_without_applying_deferred(system, world)
```

This change achieves several technical improvements:
1. **Code Simplification**: Reduces lines of code by 60% (27 lines removed vs 10 added)
2. **Safety Enhancement**: Eliminates unsafe blocks from system execution
3. **Behavior Consistency**: Ensures uniform deferred buffer handling across system types
4. **Maintainability**: Removes error-prone conditional logic

The `__rust_begin_short_backtrace` module received a new entry point to preserve debugger backtraces. The `black_box()` calls prevent compiler optimizations from removing stack frames critical for debugging.

## Key Files Changed

### crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/executor/single_threaded.rs (+10/-27)
**Purpose:** Remove special-case handling for exclusive systems  
**Key Change:**
```rust
// Before:
if system.is_exclusive() {
    __rust_begin_short_backtrace::run(system, world)
} else {
    let world = world.as_unsafe_world_cell();
    unsafe { __rust_begin_short_backtrace::run_unsafe(system, world) }
}

// After:
__rust_begin_short_backtrace::run_without_applying_deferred(system, world)
```

### crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/executor/mod.rs (+22/-5)
**Purpose:** Add new backtrace-preserving wrapper  
**Key Addition:**
```rust
#[inline(never)]
pub(super) fn run_without_applying_deferred(
    system: &mut ScheduleSystem,
    world: &mut World,
) -> Result {
    let result = system.run_without_applying_deferred((), world);
    black_box(());
    result
}
```
