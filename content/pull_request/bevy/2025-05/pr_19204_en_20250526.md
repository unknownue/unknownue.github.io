## Description Translation
# Objective

- The trigger_screenshots system gets added in `.build()` but relies on a resource that is only inserted in `.finish()`
- This isn't a bug for most users, but when doing headless mode testing it can technically work without ever calling `.finish()` and did work before bevy 0.15 but while migrating my work codebase I had an issue of test failing because of this

## Solution

- Move the trigger_screenshots system to `.finish()`

## Testing

- I ran the screenshot example and it worked as expected

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
The screenshot system contained a subtle initialization order issue. The `trigger_screenshots` system was being registered during the `.build()` phase of plugin initialization, but depended on the `CapturedScreenshots` resource that's only inserted during the `.finish()` phase. While this worked for normal application flow where `.finish()` is always called, it caused failures in headless testing scenarios where applications might skip calling `.finish()`.

This became apparent during migration to Bevy 0.15, where tests that previously passed started failing due to missing resources. The core issue was a temporal coupling between system registration and resource availability that only manifested in specific execution contexts.

### The Solution Approach
The fix required aligning the system registration with resource availability through Bevy's plugin lifecycle methods. By moving the system registration from `.build()` to `.finish()`, we ensure the `CapturedScreenshots` resource exists before the system runs. This approach maintains the existing functionality while resolving the initialization order problem.

### The Implementation
The key changes occurred in `screenshot.rs`:

1. **Removal from build phase**:
```rust
// Before in build():
.add_systems(Update, trigger_screenshots)
```

2. **Addition in finish phase**:
```rust
// After in finish():
app.add_systems(Update, trigger_screenshots)
   .insert_resource(CapturedScreenshots(Arc::new(Mutex::new(rx))));
```

This restructuring ensures both the system and its required resource are initialized together during the same lifecycle phase. The channel creation (tx/rx) remains unchanged but now co-located with the system registration.

### Technical Insights
The change leverages Bevy's explicit plugin lifecycle stages:
- `.build()`: Typically used for system registration and initial setup
- `.finish()`: Intended for final initialization steps after all plugins are built

By moving system registration to `.finish()`, we:
1. Align with Bevy's recommended patterns for resource-dependent systems
2. Prevent potential null-reference style errors in edge-case scenarios
3. Maintain backward compatibility for normal application flow

### The Impact
This change:
- Fixes headless test scenarios that skip `.finish()`
- Eliminates a subtle race condition in system initialization
- Maintains existing functionality for regular users
- Reduces maintenance burden by following Bevy's lifecycle conventions

The solution demonstrates proper use of Bevy's plugin lifecycle methods and serves as a reference for handling resource dependencies during system registration.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_render/src/view/window/screenshot.rs` (+2/-2)

**Changes**:
1. Removed `trigger_screenshots` system registration from build phase
2. Added system registration alongside resource insertion in finish phase

**Code Comparison**:
```rust
// Before in build():
impl Plugin for ScreenshotPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut bevy_app::App) {
        app.add_systems(
            Update,
            capture_screenshot_system
                .after(event_update_system)
                .before(ApplyDeferred),
        )
        .add_systems(Update, trigger_screenshots) // REMOVED FROM HERE
        .register_type::<Screenshot>()
        .register_type::<ScreenshotCaptured>();
```

```rust
// After in finish():
fn finish(&self, app: &mut bevy_app::App) {
    let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel();
    app.add_systems(Update, trigger_screenshots) // ADDED HERE
        .insert_resource(CapturedScreenshots(Arc::new(Mutex::new(rx))));
```
