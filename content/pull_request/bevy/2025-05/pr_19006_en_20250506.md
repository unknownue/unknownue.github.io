## Description Translation
# Objective

`CustomCursorUrl` is inaccessible.

## Solution

Expose `CustomCursorUrl`.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a visibility issue with the `CustomCursorUrl` type in Bevy's windowing system. This type is crucial for web targets where developers need to set custom cursors using URL resources, but it was inadvertently kept private in the module exports.

The core problem stemmed from conditional compilation attributes that didn't properly expose the type. `CustomCursorUrl` was defined in the `custom_cursor` module but only made available under specific feature flags and target platforms. However, the public export statement was missing for web targets (WASM), making the type inaccessible to users even when the required features were enabled.

The solution involved adding a targeted export statement guarded by precise conditional compilation flags:
```rust
#[cfg(all(
    feature = "custom_cursor",
    target_family = "wasm",
    target_os = "unknown"
))]
pub use crate::custom_cursor::CustomCursorUrl;
```
This change ensures:
1. The type is only exposed when the `custom_cursor` feature is active
2. Availability is restricted to WASM targets (web browsers)
3. Maintains platform-specific behavior without affecting other targets

The implementation required understanding Bevy's feature gating system and conditional compilation patterns. By adding this focused export, the PR maintains clean platform separation while fixing the visibility issue. Developers can now properly use URL-based cursors in web deployments without risking unintended API surface on native platforms.

```

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_winit/src/cursor.rs` (+7/-0)
Added conditional export for CustomCursorUrl:
```rust
#[cfg(all(
    feature = "custom_cursor",
    target_family = "wasm",
    target_os = "unknown"
))]
pub use crate::custom_cursor::CustomCursorUrl;
```
This change:
1. Makes the type available in public API surface
2. Maintains platform-specific encapsulation
3. Preserves existing native/wasm separation in cursor handling
