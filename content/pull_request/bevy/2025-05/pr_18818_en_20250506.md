## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
The Bevy engine's state management system previously used a component called `StateScoped` to manage entity lifetimes during state transitions. However, this implementation had two key limitations:

1. **Naming ambiguity**: The term "StateScoped" didn't clearly indicate when despawning occurred (on exit vs enter)
2. **Single-direction cleanup**: Only supported despawning when exiting a state, with no built-in equivalent for entering states

This became problematic for developers building state-dependent UI elements or level entities that needed cleanup on state entry rather than exit. The existing naming also made code harder to search and understand, as noted in issue #15849.

### The Solution Approach
The author addressed these issues through a three-part strategy:

1. **Semantic renaming**: 
   - `StateScoped` → `DespawnOnExitState`
   - `clear_state_scoped_entities` system → `despawn_entities_on_exit_state`

2. **New complementary component**:
   - Added `DespawnOnEnterState` with matching system `despawn_entities_on_enter_state`

3. **Architectural symmetry**:
   - Unified handling of both enter/exit transitions through similar system implementations
   - Maintained existing state scoping functionality while expanding capabilities

Key engineering decisions included:
- Preserving the existing state transition event handling pattern
- Maintaining backward compatibility through clear migration path
- Leveraging Bevy's existing state transition scheduling infrastructure

### The Implementation
The core changes occurred in `state_scoped.rs`:

```rust
// Before:
#[derive(Component)]
pub struct StateScoped<S: States>(pub S);

pub fn clear_state_scoped_entities<S: States>(
    query: Query<(Entity, &StateScoped<S>)>
) { ... }

// After:
#[derive(Component)]
pub struct DespawnOnExitState<S: States>(pub S);

#[derive(Component)]
pub struct DespawnOnEnterState<S: States>(pub S);

pub fn despawn_entities_on_exit_state<S: States>(
    query: Query<(Entity, &DespawnOnExitState<S>)>
) { ... }

pub fn despawn_entities_on_enter_state<S: States>(
    query: Query<(Entity, &DespawnOnEnterState<S>)>
) { ... }
```

The implementation maintains the same event-driven architecture but splits functionality into two symmetrical systems. Both systems:
1. Listen to `StateTransitionEvent<S>`
2. Compare entity state bindings against transition events
3. Despawn matching entities through `Commands`

### Technical Insights
The PR leverages Bevy's state transition pipeline by:
1. Using `StateTransitionSteps::ExitSchedules` for exit cleanup
2. Using `StateTransitionSteps::EnterSchedules` for enter cleanup
3. Processing only the latest transition event per frame for efficiency

Notable performance considerations:
- Single event check per frame minimizes overhead
- Bulk entity despawning through commands remains efficient
- Query filtering matches exact state variants

### The Impact
These changes provide:
1. **Clearer API semantics**: Component names directly express their behavior
2. **Bidirectional state cleanup**: Supports both entry and exit despawning patterns
3. **Improved discoverability**: Matches existing state transition terminology
4. **Backward compatibility**: Old functionality maintained under new names

The migration path is straightforward but breaking - existing users must rename `StateScoped` to `DespawnOnExitState`. The new `DespawnOnEnterState` enables novel patterns like transient loading screen entities that auto-remove when entering gameplay states.
