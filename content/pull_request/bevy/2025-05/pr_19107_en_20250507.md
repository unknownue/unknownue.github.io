## Description Translation
# Objective

In #18301, `NonSendMarker` was defined in such a way that it actually implements `Send`. This isn't strictly a soundness issue, as its goal is to be used as a `SystemParam`, and it _does_ appropriately mark system access as `!Send`. It just seems odd that `NonSendMarker: Send`.

## Solution

- Made `NonSendMarker` wrap `PhantomData<*mut ()>`, which forces it to be `!Send`.

## Testing

- CI

---

## Notes

This does mean constructing a `NonSendMarker` _value_ will require using the `SystemParam` trait, but I think that's acceptable as the marker as a value should be rarely required if at all.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a type system inconsistency in Bevy's ECS module. The `NonSendMarker` struct, introduced in a previous change (#18301), was meant to enforce single-threaded access patterns but accidentally remained `Send`-capable due to its simple unit struct implementation. While this didn't create immediate safety issues (as it's primarily used through `SystemParam` trait constraints), the discrepancy between the type's name and actual behavior presented a potential source of confusion and future maintenance risks.

The solution leverages Rust's type system mechanics by adding a `PhantomData<*mut ()>` field to the struct. Raw pointer types like `*mut ()` are inherently `!Send` in Rust, and wrapping them in `PhantomData` propagates this property to the containing struct. This change ensures the type's compile-time behavior matches its semantic purpose without requiring runtime checks.

Key implementation details:
1. Struct definition updated to include the phantom data
2. Constructor modified to initialize the new field
3. No changes needed to trait implementations due to Rust's automatic trait derivation rules

This approach maintains the existing API surface while strengthening type guarantees. The main tradeoff is that direct instantiation of `NonSendMarker` now requires going through the `SystemParam` trait, but this aligns with intended usage patterns where the marker is typically accessed through system parameters rather than constructed directly.

## Visual Representation

    A[NonSendMarker] --> B[PhantomData<*mut ()>]
    B --> C[!Send Trait]
    B --> D[!Sync Trait]
```

## Key Files Changed

**crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/system_param.rs** (+2/-2)
```rust
// Before:
pub struct NonSendMarker;

// After:
pub struct NonSendMarker(PhantomData<*mut ()>);
```
```rust
// Constructor update in SystemParam implementation:
// Before:
Self

// After:
Self(PhantomData)
```
The changes ensure the marker type properly inherits `!Send` behavior through its contained raw pointer phantom data. This modification affects only the type's composition and construction, leaving its system parameter functionality intact.
