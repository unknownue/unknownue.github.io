## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a structural issue in Bevy's picking system where the `Location` struct was incorrectly classified as a Component. This misclassification violated the intended design pattern where `PointerLocation` (which contains a `Location`) should be the actual Component used in Entity Component System (ECS) queries.

**The Problem**: 
`Location` was mistakenly marked with `#[derive(Component)]`, making it directly queryable as a component despite being designed as a data container within the `PointerLocation` component. This violated the encapsulation principle and could lead to improper system interactions, as documented in issue #17390.

**The Solution**:
The core fix involved two key changes:
1. Removing the `Component` derive from `Location` struct
2. Updating the reflection metadata to exclude `Component` reflection

Before:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Component, Reflect, PartialEq)]
#[reflect(Component, Debug, PartialEq, Clone)]
pub struct Location {
    // fields
}
```

After:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Reflect, PartialEq)]
#[reflect(Debug, PartialEq, Clone)]
pub struct Location {
    // fields
}
```

**Technical Impact**:
This change enforces the intended usage pattern where developers must interact with `PointerLocation` (the wrapper component) rather than accessing `Location` directly. The migration guide added in `picking_location_not_component.md` explicitly states:

> "`bevy_picking::Location` was erroneously made a `Component`. It is no longer one, `bevy_picking::PointerLocation` wraps a `Location` and is the intended usage pattern."

**Engineering Considerations**:
- Maintains ECS integrity by preserving the component hierarchy
- Prevents accidental direct access to internal data structures
- Requires minor migration effort for existing users but improves long-term maintainability
- Passed basic sanity checks via `cargo clippy`

## Key Files Changed

1. `crates/bevy_picking/src/pointer.rs`
```rust
// Before:
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Component, Reflect, PartialEq)]
#[reflect(Component, Debug, PartialEq, Clone)]

// After:
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Reflect, PartialEq)]
#[reflect(Debug, PartialEq, Clone)]
```
- Removed Component derivation and reflection
- Enforces proper component hierarchy
