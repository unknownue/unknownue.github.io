## Description Translation
# Objective

Minor docs fix - add missing "is responsible".

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a documentation clarity issue in Bevy's ECS module. The problem stemmed from an incomplete sentence in the documentation comment for the `Traversal` trait, which could lead to confusion about responsibility for documenting looping behavior.

The original documentation stated:
"Each implementer of `Traversal` for documenting possible looping behavior..."

This missing verb phrase created ambiguity about who bears responsibility for documenting traversal behavior. The incomplete sentence structure made it harder for developers to understand their obligations when implementing the trait.

The solution involved inserting the missing phrase "is responsible" to complete the sentence's grammatical structure and clarify responsibilities. The corrected line now reads:
"Each implementer of `Traversal` is responsible for documenting possible looping behavior..."

This change improves API documentation clarity without affecting runtime behavior. The fix targets developer experience rather than code functionality, emphasizing the importance of precise documentation in systems programming. Clear documentation is particularly crucial for the `Traversal` trait, as its implementations directly impact critical ECS operations like event propagation and relationship navigation.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/traversal.rs` (+1/-1)
**Change:** Fixed incomplete sentence in doc comment for `Traversal` trait  
**Why:** To clarify documentation responsibilities for trait implementers

```rust
// Before:
// Each implementer of `Traversal` for documenting possible looping behavior...

// After:
// Each implementer of `Traversal` is responsible for documenting possible looping behavior...
```

This single-line change directly addresses the core objective of the PR by completing the documentation sentence structure. The modification ensures developers understand that trait implementers must explicitly document any potential looping behavior in their implementations.
