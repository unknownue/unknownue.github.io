## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR represents a routine dependency update in the Bevy engine's CI pipeline. The core issue was straightforward: the crate-ci/typos GitHub Action used for spell checking needed to be updated from version 1.35.4 to 1.35.5 to incorporate recent bug fixes in the typos tool.

The typos tool is integrated into Bevy's CI workflow to catch spelling mistakes in code and documentation. Version 1.35.5 of crate-ci/typos contained important fixes for several incorrect corrections in the tool's dictionary. These fixes addressed issues with suggested corrections for words like "accidently," "dynamincally," and "interruptability," among others. Without this update, the CI system could potentially suggest wrong corrections or miss actual typos.

The solution approach was minimal and targeted: update the version tag in the GitHub Actions workflow file. This is a standard maintenance task that ensures the project benefits from the latest improvements in its dependencies. The change was automatically generated by Dependabot, GitHub's dependency management service, which monitors project dependencies and creates PRs when updates are available.

The implementation involved a single-line change in the CI configuration file. The update from v1.35.4 to v1.35.5 ensures that the spell checking step in Bevy's CI pipeline uses the most accurate version of the typos tool available. This maintains the quality of the codebase by catching legitimate spelling errors while reducing false positives from incorrect corrections.

From a technical perspective, this change demonstrates the importance of keeping development tools updated, even for seemingly minor dependencies. The typos tool plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality and documentation standards, and using the latest version ensures it operates with the highest accuracy.

The impact of this change is subtle but meaningful. It improves the accuracy of spell checking in the CI pipeline without requiring any changes to the actual Bevy codebase. This helps maintain professional standards in documentation and comments while reducing noise from incorrect spell check suggestions.

## Key Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (+1/-1)

This file contains the GitHub Actions workflow configuration for Bevy's continuous integration pipeline. The change updates the version of the crate-ci/typos action used in the spell checking job.

**Code Change:**
```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Before:
-        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.35.4

# After:
+        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.35.5
```

This single-line change updates the typos checker from version 1.35.4 to 1.35.5, ensuring the CI pipeline uses the latest version with improved correction accuracy.
