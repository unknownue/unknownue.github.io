## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a small but meaningful optimization in Bevy's shadow rendering system. The change occurs in the cascade processing logic where we compute the transformation from world space to light space. Previously, the code was constructing a rotation matrix from a light's transform and then computing its inverse to get the light-to-world transformation. The key insight here is that for pure rotation matrices (which are orthogonal), the inverse is mathematically equivalent to the transpose. Matrix transposition is computationally cheaper and numerically more stable than full matrix inversion.

The original implementation used `transform.compute_transform().rotation` to extract the rotation component. This was replaced with the more direct `transform.rotation()` method, which avoids unnecessary computation since we only need the rotation quaternion. The subsequent matrix operation was then changed from `inverse()` to `transpose()`, leveraging the mathematical property that for rotation matrices, inverse equals transpose.

These changes provide three concrete benefits:
1. **Performance improvement**: Matrix transpose is O(n²) while inverse is O(n³) for n×n matrices
2. **Numerical stability**: Transpose avoids potential floating-point precision issues in inverse calculations
3. **Code simplification**: The more efficient operation better expresses the mathematical intent

The author validated these changes using Bevy's `shadow_bias` example, confirming that shadow rendering behavior remains correct while gaining these optimizations. This is a good example of a precise, localized optimization that leverages mathematical properties to improve both performance and code quality without changing functionality.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_light/src/cascade.rs`
**Changes:**
1. Optimized rotation extraction from light transform
2. Replaced matrix inverse with transpose operation

**Before:**
```rust
let world_from_light = Mat4::from_quat(transform.compute_transform().rotation);
let light_to_world_inverse = world_from_light.inverse();
```

**After:**
```rust
let world_from_light = Mat4::from_quat(transform.rotation());
let light_to_world_inverse = world_from_light.transpose();
```

**Why:**
- `transform.rotation()` directly accesses the rotation component without computing the full transform
- `transpose()` replaces `inverse()` for better performance and numerical stability
- Both changes maintain identical mathematical results for rotation matrices
