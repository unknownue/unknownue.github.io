## Description Translation
# Objective

Just fixes a few doc links that were lost in the original bevy_mesh split since it didnt include the Mesh3d/Mesh2d components. Now it does, so lets link again.

## The Story of This Pull Request

This PR addresses a documentation issue that emerged from a previous architectural change in the Bevy engine. When the bevy_mesh module was split into separate components, some documentation links became broken because they referenced components that were no longer in the same module.

The core problem was straightforward: documentation comments contained plain text references to `Mesh3d` and `Mesh2d` components without proper Markdown link syntax. These components were originally part of the mesh module but were moved during the architectural split. While the components themselves were properly relocated, the documentation links weren't updated to reflect the new module structure.

The solution implemented here is a clean, surgical fix: converting plain text component names into proper Rustdoc links using the bracket syntax `[`Component`](crate::Component)`. This approach ensures that:
1. The documentation becomes clickable and navigable
2. IDE tooltips will work correctly with these links
3. The generated documentation will properly cross-reference the components

The changes are minimal but impactful. In `mesh.rs`, the main Mesh struct documentation now properly links to both `Mesh2d` and `Mesh3d` components. In `morph.rs`, multiple documentation comments that reference `Mesh3d` have been updated with proper links.

What's notable about this fix is that it doesn't change any functionality - it purely improves the developer experience by making the documentation more useful and navigable. The links now correctly point to the actual component definitions, allowing developers to quickly jump to the relevant code when reading documentation.

The implementation follows Rust's documentation best practices by using relative paths within the crate (`crate::ComponentName`) rather than absolute paths, making the documentation more resilient to future module reorganizations.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_mesh/src/mesh.rs` (+3/-3)
This file contains the main Mesh struct definition. The changes fix documentation links to reference Mesh2d and Mesh3d components properly.

**Key changes:**
```rust
// Before:
// Meshes can be rendered with a `Mesh2d` and `MeshMaterial2d`
// or `Mesh3d` and `MeshMaterial3d` for 2D and 3D respectively.

// After:
// Meshes can be rendered with a [`Mesh2d`](crate::Mesh2d) and `MeshMaterial2d`
// or [`Mesh3d`](crate::Mesh3d) and `MeshMaterial3d` for 2D and 3D respectively.
```

```rust
// Before:
// used in a `Mesh3d` with a square bevy logo texture, with added axis, points,

// After:
// used in a [`Mesh3d`](crate::Mesh3d) with a square bevy logo texture, with added axis, points,
```

### `crates/bevy_mesh/src/morph.rs` (+5/-5)
This file handles morph target animation functionality. The changes fix multiple documentation references to Mesh3d.

**Key changes:**
```rust
// Before:
// Controls the [morph targets] for all child `Mesh3d` entities.

// After:
// Controls the [morph targets] for all child [`Mesh3d`](crate::Mesh3d) entities.
```

```rust
// Before:
// synchronized to child `Mesh3d` / [`MeshMorphWeights`]

// After:
// synchronized to child [`Mesh3d`](crate::Mesh3d) / [`MeshMorphWeights`]
```

```rust
// Before:
// Add this to the parent of one or more [`Entities`](`Entity`) with a `Mesh3d`

// After:
// Add this to the parent of one or more [`Entities`](`Entity`) with a [`Mesh3d`](crate::Mesh3d)
```

```rust
// Before:
// The first child `Mesh3d` primitive controlled by these weights.

// After:
// The first child [`Mesh3d`](crate::Mesh3d) primitive controlled by these weights.
```

```rust
// Before:
// Add this to an [`Entity`] with a `Mesh3d` with a [`MorphAttributes`] set

// After:
// Add this to an [`Entity`] with a [`Mesh3d`](crate::Mesh3d) with a [`MorphAttributes`] set
```
