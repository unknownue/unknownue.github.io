-(TODO: Embed screenshot of atmosphere-generated reflections)
-
-You can now have dynamic reflections and ambient light in your scene that match the procedural sky.
-
-As the sky changes, reflections on shiny and rough materials update automatically to stay consistent — no pre-baked environment maps needed.
-
-To enable this for a camera, add the new component `AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight` to the camera entity:
-
-```rust
-commands.spawn((
-    Camera3d::default(),
-    // Generates an environment cubemap from the atmosphere for this view
-    AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight::default(),
-));
-```
-
-Note that this is a per-view effect (per camera). Light probes are not yet supported.

+(TODO: Embed screenshot of atmosphere-generated reflections)

 An environment map needs to be processed to be able to support uses beyond a simple skybox,
 such as reflections at different roughness levels, and ambient light contribution.
 This process is called filtering, and can either be done ahead of time (prefiltering), or
 in realtime, although at a reduced quality.
 
 Bevy already supported prefiltering, but its not always possible to prefilter: sometimes,
-you only gain access to an environment map at runtime, for whatever reason.
-Typically this is from realtime reflection probes, but can also be from other sources
-for example, from a procedural skybox.
+your environment map is not available until runtime.
+Typically this is from realtime reflection probes, but you might also, for example,
+be using a procedural skybox.
 
 Now, Bevy supports both modes of filtering!
 Adding a `GeneratedEnvironmentMapLight` to a `Camera` entity lets you use any environment map
 with Bevy's renderer, and enjoy all the benefits of prefiltering with none of the asset processing.

+It is now possible to use cameras, lights, shaders, images, meshes, sprites, text, ui, picking, animation, and scenes without depending on the Bevy renderer. This makes it possible for 3rd party custom renderers (as might be required on console, or for teams with divergent goals) to act as drop-in replacements for rendering existing scenes.
 
 This is incredibly important for reducing compile time, especially for 3rd party crates: crate authors can now depend more granularly on the specific crates they need, meaning greater chances for compilation parallelism emerge as not everything is bottlenecked on waiting for the bevy_render -> bevy_core_pipelines -> bevy_pbr/bevy_sprite chain to compile.
