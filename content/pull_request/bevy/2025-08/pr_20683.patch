-title: Camera Restructure
-pull_requests: [18873]
----
-
-As part of the rendering crate reorganization, we've been working to simplify Bevy `Camera`s:
-
-- `Camera.hdr` has been split out into a new marker component, `Hdr`
-  - before: `commands.spawn((Camera3d, Camera { hdr: true, ..default() });`
-  - after: `commands.spawn((Camera3d, Hdr));`
-  - rendering effects can now `#[require(Hdr)]` if they only function with an HDR camera.
-    This is currently implemented for `Bloom`, `AutoExposure`, and `Atmosphere`
