## Description Translation
# Objective

- Follow up on the PR to add the release note
- keep a friendly tone with no technical details (they are in the PR)
- focus on the use cases rather than implementation details

## The Story of This Pull Request
This documentation PR addresses the need to properly document a recently implemented rendering feature in Bevy. The original implementation PR (#20529) added support for atmosphere-generated environment maps but didn't include corresponding release notes. This follow-up ensures users will understand the feature's purpose and benefits when it ships.

The problem was straightforward: without proper release documentation, users wouldn't discover the new capability or understand how to implement it. The solution required creating a concise, user-focused explanation that highlights practical benefits rather than technical implementation details. This approach follows Bevy's documentation standards where release notes focus on what users can achieve with new features.

The implementation consists of a single Markdown file that:
1. Announces the feature with a descriptive title
2. Credits the original PR and authors
3. Explains the practical benefits for scene rendering
4. Provides a clear code example for implementation
5. Notes current limitations and future possibilities

The release note specifically avoids technical details about the rendering implementation since those belong in the original PR and codebase documentation. Instead, it focuses on the user experience benefits - mainly how environment maps now automatically stay consistent with procedural sky changes without requiring pre-baked assets.

One notable engineering decision was making the feature per-camera rather than using light probes. The documentation explicitly calls out this implementation detail as a current limitation ("Light probes are not yet supported") while leaving room for future expansion. The code example shows the minimal implementation required - adding a single component to a camera entity.

The impact of this PR is improved discoverability and usability of the atmosphere environment map feature. By providing clear usage documentation at release time, users can immediately benefit from the dynamic reflection system without digging through implementation PRs or source code.

## Key Files Changed
### `release-content/release-notes/atmosphere_environment_map.md` (new file)
This file contains the complete release note documentation for the atmosphere environment map feature.

(TODO: Embed screenshot of atmosphere-generated reflections)

You can now have dynamic reflections and ambient light in your scene that match the procedural sky.

As the sky changes, reflections on shiny and rough materials update automatically to stay consistent — no pre-baked environment maps needed.

To enable this for a camera, add the new component `AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight` to the camera entity:

```rust
commands.spawn((
    Camera3d::default(),
    // Generates an environment cubemap from the atmosphere for this view
    AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight::default(),
));
```

Note that this is a per-view effect (per camera). Light probes are not yet supported.

Special thanks to @atlv24, @JMS55 and @ecoskey for reviews and feedback.

Key aspects:
- User-focused description of benefits
- Clear code example showing minimal implementation
- Explicit note about current limitations
- Credit to contributors
