### Description Translation
I stopped updating it since it was causing merge conflicts, but now everything's frozen so it's a good time.

### The Story of This Pull Request

The problem originated from ongoing documentation maintenance for the `RenderStartup` initiative - a series of architectural changes to Bevy's rendering system. As multiple contributors worked on related pull requests concurrently, updating the centralized list of PR references in release documentation caused repeated merge conflicts. The author strategically deferred these documentation updates to avoid blocking other development work.

When the codebase reached a stable point (the release freeze period), the author revisited these documentation files. This timing was optimal because: 1) no new PRs would be added to the initiative before release, 2) the risk of merge conflicts was eliminated, and 3) the documentation could be finalized accurately for the upcoming release.

The solution was straightforward: update the `pull_requests` metadata fields in two markdown files to include all completed PRs related to the `RenderStartup` changes. The implementation consisted of modifying the YAML front matter in both files to reflect the comprehensive list of PR numbers. No functional code changes were needed since this was purely a documentation update.

The impact of these changes is improved documentation accuracy and contributor attribution. The updated lists: 
1. Give proper credit to all contributors involved in the `RenderStartup` initiative
2. Provide complete traceability for the architectural changes
3. Serve as better historical records for future reference
4. Maintain consistency between migration guides and release notes

This approach demonstrates a practical documentation maintenance strategy: defer non-critical documentation updates during active development to avoid merge conflicts, then complete them during stabilization periods when the risk of conflicts is minimal.
