## The Story of This Pull Request

This pull request updates the `crate-ci/typos` GitHub Action from version 1.35.3 to 1.35.4 in Bevy's CI pipeline. The primary motivation for this change is to incorporate a critical fix in the typos tool that addresses an issue in its dictionary. Specifically, the previous version contained an incorrect correction suggestion for the misspelling "exctracting" - instead of suggesting the proper correction "extracting", it was suggesting another invalid spelling. This could potentially introduce new typos if developers automatically applied the incorrect suggestion.

The dependency update process was automated through Dependabot, GitHub's dependency management service. Dependabot detected the new patch release (1.35.4) of the `typos` action and automatically generated this PR to update the version reference in Bevy's CI configuration file. The compatibility score badge shows that the update has no compatibility issues, indicating a safe upgrade path.

For Bevy, maintaining an accurate spell-checking tool is important for documentation quality and code readability. The `typos` action runs as part of the CI pipeline's "Check Markdown" job, scanning all documentation files for spelling errors. By updating to the fixed version, Bevy ensures that:
1. The tool won't suggest incorrect corrections
2. New documentation contributions will be checked more accurately
3. False positives in the spell-checking process are reduced

The implementation is straightforward - a single-line change in the CI configuration file that updates the version tag for the `crate-ci/typos` action. The simplicity of this change reflects the nature of dependency maintenance where updates are often atomic version bumps. The CI pipeline's structure remains unchanged, with the typos check continuing to run at the same point in the workflow.

After passing CI checks, this PR was merged within 13 hours of creation, demonstrating Bevy's efficient maintenance of dependencies. The quick merge cycle helps keep the project's tooling current while minimizing the window where incorrect spell-check suggestions could affect contributions.

## Key Files Changed

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
This file defines Bevy's GitHub Actions CI pipeline configuration. The change updates the version of the `typos` action used in the documentation checking stage.

**Before:**
```yaml
      - name: Check for typos
        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.35.3
```

**After:**
```yaml
      - name: Check for typos
        uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.35.4
```

The update from `v1.35.3` to `v1.35.4` ensures the CI pipeline uses the latest bug-fixed version of the spell-checking tool. This change directly addresses the specific dictionary correction issue described in the release notes.
