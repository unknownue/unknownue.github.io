## Analysis of PR #20602: Update and coalesce migration guides and release notes for crate refactors

### Basic Information
- **Title**: update and coalesce migration guides and release notes for crate refactors

### Description Translation
**Objective**
- migration guide for #20587
- combine migration and note for #18703

**Solution**
- also attempt to sort the PRs roughly by importance (this is really hard to do tbh)

### The Story of This Pull Request

This documentation-focused PR addresses two primary needs in Bevy's release content. First, it provides a migration guide for PR #20587 which moved sprite rendering types to a new crate. Second, it consolidates documentation for PR #18703 (which extracted UI rendering types) into existing migration guides and release notes, eliminating redundant files.

The core problem was that recent crate extraction work (#18703 and #20587) lacked proper migration documentation and their release notes were scattered. This created potential confusion for users upgrading between versions. The solution involved:
1. Adding new sections to the main render reorganization migration guide
2. Consolidating UI rendering documentation into existing files
3. Updating release notes to reflect the broader impact of crate extractions
4. Attempting to sort PR references by importance

The author made key implementation decisions to maintain documentation clarity:
- Instead of separate files for each extraction, related changes are grouped under common headings
- Migration steps are presented with explicit before/after import paths
- Release notes now emphasize compile-time benefits for third-party crate authors

A notable challenge was sorting PR references meaningfully. As the author noted: "this is really hard to do tbh" - acknowledging the subjective nature of prioritizing changes in a large-scale refactor.

The changes improve documentation coherence by:
- Reducing documentation fragmentation
- Providing clear migration paths for both UI and sprite rendering changes
- Highlighting how multiple extractions collectively enable renderer-agnostic scenes
- Emphasizing compile-time benefits for ecosystem developers
