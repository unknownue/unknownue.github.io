## Description Translation
Some internal cleanups and also some performance improvements when retrieving processes in linux... which is not used by bevy, so mostly just updating to keep it up-to-date. :laughing: 

## The Story of This Pull Request

The primary goal of this PR was to maintain dependency currency in the Bevy engine by updating the `sysinfo` crate from version `0.36.0` to `0.37.0`. Dependency updates like this are routine maintenance tasks that ensure the codebase benefits from upstream improvements while minimizing technical debt accumulation.

The `sysinfo` crate provides system information gathering capabilities, which Bevy uses through its `bevy_diagnostic` crate for platform-specific system monitoring. While the newer version of `sysinfo` includes performance optimizations for Linux process retrieval, the author notes that Bevy doesn't currently utilize this specific functionality. Therefore, the immediate performance benefits aren't directly applicable to Bevy's current implementation.

The technical implementation was straightforward but required careful attention to platform-specific configuration. The update involved modifying two dependency declarations in `Cargo.toml` to reference the new version while preserving the existing feature flags and platform-specific configurations. The platform targeting logic remained unchanged since the update maintains compatibility with the existing target OS constraints (macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, and FreeBSD).

From an engineering perspective, this change demonstrates the importance of regular dependency maintenance. Even when immediate performance gains aren't realized, keeping dependencies current provides several benefits:
1. Reduces future migration effort by preventing version gaps
2. Ensures access to security patches and bug fixes
3. Maintains compatibility with other ecosystem updates

The minimal scope of changes (only two lines modified) and the absence of required code adjustments indicate that the `sysinfo` API remained stable between these versions, making this a low-risk update. The PR was quickly reviewed and merged within the same day, confirming its straightforward nature.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_diagnostic/Cargo.toml`
This file contains the dependency specifications for Bevy's diagnostic system. The changes update the `sysinfo` dependency version while preserving all platform-specific configurations and feature flags.

**Key modifications:**
```diff
# macOS
[target.'cfg(all(target_os="macos"))'.dependencies]
# Some features of sysinfo are not supported by apple. This will disable those features on apple devices
- sysinfo = { version = "0.36.0", optional = true, default-features = false, features = [
+ sysinfo = { version = "0.37.0", optional = true, default-features = false, features = [
  "apple-app-store",
  "system",
] }

# Only include when on linux/windows/android/freebsd
[target.'cfg(any(target_os = "linux", target_os = "windows", target_os = "android", target_os = "freebsd"))'.dependencies]
- sysinfo = { version = "0.36.0", optional = true, default-features = false, features = [
+ sysinfo = { version = "0.37.0", optional = true, default-features = false, features = [
  "system",
] }
```

The changes:
1. Updated version specifier from `0.36.0` to `0.37.0` for macOS targets
2. Updated version specifier from `0.36.0` to `0.37.0` for Linux/Windows/Android/FreeBSD targets
3. Preserved all existing feature flags and platform-specific configurations
4. Maintained identical conditional compilation attributes
