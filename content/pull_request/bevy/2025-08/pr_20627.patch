+(TODO: Embed screenshot of atmosphere-generated reflections)
+
+You can now have dynamic reflections and ambient light in your scene that match the procedural sky.
+
+As the sky changes, reflections on shiny and rough materials update automatically to stay consistent â€” no pre-baked environment maps needed.
+
+To enable this for a camera, add the new component `AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight` to the camera entity:
+
+```rust
+commands.spawn((
+    Camera3d::default(),
+    // Generates an environment cubemap from the atmosphere for this view
+    AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight::default(),
+));
+```
+
+Note that this is a per-view effect (per camera). Light probes are not yet supported.
+
+Special thanks to @atlv24, @JMS55 and @ecoskey for reviews and feedback.
