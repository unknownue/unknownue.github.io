## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
Bevy's rendering system relies on several environment variables to control behavior at runtime, particularly those related to the underlying wgpu graphics library. Before this PR, there was no centralized documentation within the codebase explaining these environment variables. This created several issues:

1. Developers had to search through issues or external documentation to discover available configuration options
2. Important debugging tools like `WGPU_DEBUG` and `VERBOSE_SHADER_ERROR` weren't formally documented
3. Environment variables critical for CI/testing like `WGPU_FORCE_FALLBACK_ADAPTER` weren't easily discoverable
4. The `bevy_render` crate lacked module-level documentation despite being a core component

This documentation gap was especially problematic because environment variables are the primary mechanism for configuring low-level rendering behavior in production and development environments.

### The Solution Approach
The solution was straightforward: add comprehensive module-level documentation to `bevy_render/src/lib.rs` that lists and explains all relevant environment variables. The approach focused on:

1. Covering both Bevy-specific and wgpu environment variables in one place
2. Providing practical examples of when each variable might be useful
3. Placing the documentation at the top of the module for maximum visibility
4. Maintaining consistency with Rust's documentation conventions

No alternatives were considered since module documentation is the standard place for this type of information in Rust projects. The implementation was kept minimal to avoid maintenance overhead while providing immediate value.

### The Implementation
The implementation added a single module documentation block at the top of `bevy_render/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
//! # Useful Environment Variables
//!
//! Both `bevy_render` and `wgpu` have a number of environment variable options for changing the runtime behavior
//! of both crates. Many of these may be useful in development or release environments.
//!
//! - `WGPU_DEBUG=1` enables debug labels, which can be useful in release builds.
//! - `WGPU_VALIDATION=0` disables validation layers. This can help with particularly spammy errors.
//! - `WGPU_FORCE_FALLBACK_ADAPTER=1` attempts to force software rendering. This typically matches what is used in CI.
//! - `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` allows selecting a specific adapter by name.
//! - `WGPU_SETTINGS_PRIO=webgl2` uses webgl2 limits.
//! - `WGPU_SETTINGS_PRIO=compatibility` uses webgpu limits.
//! - `VERBOSE_SHADER_ERROR=1` prints more detailed information about WGSL compilation errors, such as shader defs and shader entrypoint.
```

The documentation covers seven environment variables with clear explanations of their effects:
- Debugging aids (`WGPU_DEBUG`, `VERBOSE_SHADER_ERROR`)
- Performance/validation controls (`WGPU_VALIDATION`)
- Adapter selection (`WGPU_FORCE_FALLBACK_ADAPTER`, `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME`)
- Backend configuration (`WGPU_SETTINGS_PRIO` variants)

Each entry includes practical usage notes, such as mentioning that `WGPU_FORCE_FALLBACK_ADAPTER` is commonly used in CI environments.

### Technical Insights
Key technical aspects of this implementation:

1. **Module Documentation Conventions**: Using `//!` comments at the top of `lib.rs` follows Rust's standard for crate-level documentation. This content will appear as the main documentation page for `bevy_render` on docs.rs.

2. **wgpu Integration**: The documentation acknowledges that many variables originate from wgpu while still including Bevy-specific variables (`VERBOSE_SHADER_ERROR`). This accurately reflects the layered nature of Bevy's rendering stack.

3. **Environment Variable Semantics**: The documentation clarifies that:
   - Boolean flags use `=1`/`=0` syntax
   - Selection variables use specific string values
   - Some variables take free-form input (`WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME`)

4. **Practical Guidance**: Each entry includes context about when the variable might be useful (e.g., "in release builds", "for particularly spammy errors", "in CI").

### The Impact
This change provides immediate value with no downsides:
1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Centralized documentation reduces time spent searching for configuration options
2. **Better Debugging**: More developers will discover tools like `VERBOSE_SHADER_ERROR`
3. **Easier Testing**: Explicit mention of CI-related variables helps contributors replicate CI environments
4. **Reduced Support Burden**: Common questions about environment configuration are now answered in the docs
5. **Zero Runtime Impact**: Pure documentation change with no effect on compiled code

The PR was quickly reviewed and merged, indicating consensus on its value to the project.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_render/src/lib.rs`
**What changed**: Added module-level documentation for environment variables  
**Why**: To provide centralized documentation for runtime configuration options  

**Before**:
```rust
#![expect(missing_docs, reason = "Not all docs are written yet, see #3492.")]
#![expect(unsafe_code, reason = "Unsafe code is used to improve performance.")]
#![cfg_attr(
```

**After**:
```rust
//! # Useful Environment Variables
//!
//! Both `bevy_render` and `wgpu` have a number of environment variable options for changing the runtime behavior
//! of both crates. Many of these may be useful in development or release environments.
//!
//! - `WGPU_DEBUG=1` enables debug labels, which can be useful in release builds.
//! - `WGPU_VALIDATION=0` disables validation layers. This can help with particularly spammy errors.
//! - `WGPU_FORCE_FALLBACK_ADAPTER=1` attempts to force software rendering. This typically matches what is used in CI.
//! - `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` allows selecting a specific adapter by name.
//! - `WGPU_SETTINGS_PRIO=webgl2` uses webgl2 limits.
//! - `WGPU_SETTINGS_PRIO=compatibility` uses webgpu limits.
//! - `VERBOSE_SHADER_ERROR=1` prints more detailed information about WGSL compilation errors, such as shader defs and shader entrypoint.

#![expect(missing_docs, reason = "Not all docs are written yet, see #3492.")]
#![expect(unsafe_code, reason = "Unsafe code is used to improve performance.")]
#![cfg_attr(
```

**Relation to PR purpose**: This change directly implements the PR's objective by documenting environment variables in the module where they're most relevant.
