## The Story of This Pull Request
While working with Bevy's ECS error handling example, a developer noticed a grammatical error in the explanatory comments. The comment incorrectly stated "Here we it using" instead of the grammatically correct "Here we are using". This minor typo could cause confusion for developers reading the example, particularly those learning about Bevy's error handling mechanisms.

The error occurred in a comment explaining how to configure global error handlers in Bevy applications. Since examples serve as educational resources, maintaining clear and correct documentation is important for effective knowledge transfer. The typo fix required minimal changes but improved the clarity of the documentation.

The fix was straightforward: replacing "we it using" with "we are using" in the comment. This maintains consistency with surrounding comments that use proper grammar while preserving all technical content. The change was reviewed and merged quickly since it didn't affect any functional code and clearly improved the example's quality.
