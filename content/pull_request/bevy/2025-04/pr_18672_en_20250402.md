## Description Translation
# Objective

In #17905 we swapped to a named field on `ChildOf` to help resolve variable naming ambiguity of child vs parent (ex: `child_of.parent` clearly reads as "I am accessing the parent of the child_of relationship", whereas `child_of.0` is less clear).

Unfortunately this has the side effect of making initialization less ideal. `ChildOf { parent }` reads just as well as `ChildOf(parent)`, but `ChildOf { parent: root }` doesn't read nearly as well as `ChildOf(root)`.

## Solution

Move back to `ChildOf(pub Entity)` but add a `child_of.parent()` function and use it for all accesses. The downside here is that users are no longer "forced" to access the parent field with `parent` nomenclature, but I think this strikes the right balance.

Take a look at the diff. I think the results provide strong evidence for this change. Initialization has the benefit of reading much better _and_ of taking up significantly less space, as many lines go from 3 to 1, and we're cutting out a bunch of syntax in some cases.

Sadly I do think this should land in 0.16 as the cost of doing this _after_ the relationships migration is high.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a tension between code clarity and ergonomics in Bevy's ECS hierarchy component `ChildOf`. Originally changed to a named struct to improve field access clarity (#17905), this introduced verbosity in component initialization that became problematic across the codebase.

**The Problem** emerged when initializing `ChildOf` components required more verbose syntax (`ChildOf { parent: entity }`) compared to the previous tuple struct version (`ChildOf(entity)`). While named fields improved access clarity (`child_of.parent`), they made creation patterns - particularly in tests and examples - more cumbersome.

**The Solution** adopts a hybrid approach:
1. Revert to tuple struct `ChildOf(pub Entity)`
2. Add a `parent()` method for field access
3. Update all internal accesses to use the method

This preserves initialization ergonomics while encouraging (though not enforcing) clear access patterns through method calls. The implementation required coordinated changes across multiple systems that interact with hierarchy relationships.

Key code changes in `crates/bevy_ecs/src/hierarchy.rs`:
```rust
// Before: Named struct with explicit field
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default, Clone)]
pub struct ChildOf {
    pub parent: Entity
}

// After: Tuple struct with accessor method
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default, Clone)]
pub struct ChildOf(pub Entity);

impl ChildOf {
    pub fn parent(&self) -> Entity {
        self.0
    }
}
```

**Technical Insights** reveal a pragmatic trade-off:
- **Initialization Efficiency**: Reduces line count and visual clutter in component creation
- **Access Clarity**: Maintains self-documenting access through `parent()` method
- **Migration Cost**: Required updating ~50 instances across the codebase to use either tuple initialization or method access

The changes particularly impacted systems dealing with:
1. Scene spawning
2. UI focus management
3. Entity cloning
4. Transform propagation

Example migration in `crates/bevy_scene/src/dynamic_scene.rs`:
```rust
// Before: Named field access
child_of.parent = parent_entity;

// After: Tuple field access with method
ChildOf(parent_entity);
child_of.parent();
```

**The Impact** is immediately visible in code compression:
- Multiple 3-line initializations reduced to single lines
- Complex hierarchy setup code became more scanable
- Maintained type safety and relationship integrity

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/hierarchy.rs` (+50/-47)
**Core component definition changes:**
```rust
// Before
pub struct ChildOf {
    pub parent: Entity
}

// After 
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default, Clone)]
pub struct ChildOf(pub Entity);

impl ChildOf {
    pub fn parent(&self) -> Entity {
        self.0
    }
}
```
This fundamental change propagates through all hierarchy interactions.

### `crates/bevy_scene/src/dynamic_scene.rs` (+3/-18)
**Example of migration impact:**
```rust
// Before: Explicit field assignment
world.entity_mut(child).insert(ChildOf { parent });

// After: Tuple initialization
world.entity_mut(child).insert(ChildOf(parent));
```
Reduces boilerplate in scene construction.

### `crates/bevy_input_focus/src/tab_navigation.rs` (+2/-16)
**UI system adaptation:**
```rust
// Before: Named field access
if world.get::<ChildOf>(*related).is_some_and(|c| c.parent == id)

// After: Method access
if world.get::<ChildOf>(*related).is_some_and(|c| c.parent() == id)
```
Maintains comparison logic while updating access style.
