## Description Translation
# Objective

Fixes #18808

## Solution

When an asset emits a removed event, mark it as modified in the render world to ensure any appropriate bookkeeping runs as necessary.

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a subtle bug in Bevy's render asset management where removing assets didn't trigger necessary updates in the render world. This could leave dangling references or prevent proper resource cleanup. The core issue stemmed from how asset removal events were handled differently from modification events in the rendering pipeline.

In Bevy's ECS architecture, render assets maintain three tracking sets:
1. `added` - Newly created assets
2. `modified` - Changed assets needing updates
3. `removed` - Assets scheduled for deletion

The existing implementation in `render_asset.rs` only populated the `modified` set when assets were added or changed, but not when they were removed. This meant systems relying on `modified` to trigger cleanup operations wouldn't execute when assets were removed.

The solution modifies the event handling logic to treat removed assets as modified. This ensures existing systems that process modified assets will handle removal cleanup without requiring separate removal handling. The key change occurs in the `track_asset_events` function:

```rust
// Before
for event in events.read() {
    match event {
        AssetEvent::Added { id } => {
            added.insert(*id);
            modified.insert(*id);
        }
        AssetEvent::Modified { id } => {
            modified.insert(*id);
        }
        AssetEvent::Removed { id } => {
            removed.insert(*id);
            // Missing modified.insert(*id)
        }
    }
}

// After
AssetEvent::Removed { id } => {
    removed.insert(*id);
    modified.insert(*id); // Added line
}
```

By adding the `modified.insert(*id)` call for removed assets, the implementation leverages existing modification handling pathways to process removals. This approach maintains the system's efficiency while fixing the cleanup issue with minimal code changes.

The technical insight here is that render asset cleanup often needs similar operations to modification handling (e.g., releasing GPU resources). Treating removals as modifications allows reuse of existing update logic rather than creating parallel removal-handling systems. This decision keeps the codebase maintainable while ensuring consistent resource management.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_render/src/render_asset.rs` (+14/-7)
**Purpose**: Fix asset removal handling in render world

Key modification in `track_asset_events` function:
```rust
// Before handling of Removed event:
AssetEvent::Removed { id } => {
    removed.insert(*id);
}

// Updated implementation:
AssetEvent::Removed { id } => {
    removed.insert(*id);
    modified.insert(*id);
}
```
This change ensures removed assets are marked as modified, triggering necessary cleanup in systems that process modified assets.
