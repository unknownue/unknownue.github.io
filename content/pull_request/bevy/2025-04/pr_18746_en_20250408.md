# Expose the added tick for change detection, both getting and setting.

## Basic Information
- **Title**: Expose the added tick for change detection, both getting and setting.
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18746
- **Author**: moonheart08
- **Status**: MERGED
- **Labels**: C-Feature, D-Trivial, A-ECS, S-Ready-For-Final-Review
- **Created**: 2025-04-07T08:55:54Z
- **Merged**: 2025-04-08T21:33:11Z
- **Merged By**: alice-i-cecile

## Description Translation
# Objective

- Allow viewing and setting the added tick for change detection aware data, to allow operations like checking if the value has been modified since first being added, and spoofing that state (i.e. returning the value to default in place without a remove/insert dance)

## Solution

- Added corresponding functions matching the existing `changed` API:
  - `fn added(&self) -> Tick`
  - `fn set_added(&mut self)`
  - `fn set_last_added(&mut self, last_added: Tick)`

Discussed on discord @ https://canary.discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/749335865876021248/1358718892465193060

## Testing

- Running the bevy test suite by.. making a PR, heck.
- No new tests were introduced due to triviality (i.e. I don't know what to test about this API, and the corresponding API for `changed` is similarly lacking tests.)

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS) uses change detection to track modifications to components. While the existing API provided methods to inspect and manipulate the "changed" state through `changed()` and related methods, there was no equivalent for the "added" state. This gap prevented developers from:

1. Determining when a component was initially added
2. Modifying the added state without physical removal/reinsertion
3. Implementing state reset patterns efficiently

The absence of these capabilities forced workarounds like component removal/reinsertion, which is less efficient than in-place modification.

### The Solution Approach
The PR mirrors the existing change detection API pattern for consistency. By adding three new methods to the `DetectChanges` trait, it completes the symmetry between "changed" and "added" state management:

1. `added()` - Exposes the tick when the component was added
2. `set_added()` - Marks the component as newly added in the current tick
3. `set_last_added()` - Allows explicit historical tick tracking

This approach maintains API consistency while addressing the missing functionality. The implementation required careful consideration of the existing change detection mechanics to ensure proper tick management.

### The Implementation
The core changes occur in `change_detection.rs` where new methods were added to the `DetectChanges` trait and its implementations:

```rust
// Added to DetectChanges trait
fn added(&self) -> Tick;
fn set_added(&mut self);
fn set_last_added(&mut self, last_added: Tick);

// Implementation for Mut<'_, T>
fn added(&self) -> Tick {
    self.ticks().added
}

fn set_added(&mut self) {
    self.ticks_mut().added = self.change_tick();
}

fn set_last_added(&mut self, last_added: Tick) {
    self.ticks_mut().added = last_added;
}
```

These methods directly parallel the existing `changed` API structure, maintaining consistency:
```rust
// Existing changed API for reference
fn changed(&self) -> bool;
fn set_changed(&mut self);
fn set_last_changed(&mut self, last_change: Tick);
```

### Technical Insights
The implementation leverages Bevy's tick-based change detection system:
- **Ticks**: Monotonically increasing counter tracking world state changes
- **Component Ticks**: Each component stores:
  - `added`: Tick when component was added
  - `changed`: Last tick when component was modified
- **Change Detection**: Compares component ticks to system's last execution tick

The new methods expose the previously internal `added` tick, enabling:
- Historical comparison: `component.added() > system_last_run`
- State manipulation: Reset components to "newly added" state without recreation
- Debugging: Inspection of addition timing in complex systems

### The Impact
These changes enable new patterns in Bevy development:
1. **State Reset**:
```rust
// Instead of:
commands.entity(e).remove::<Component>().insert(Component::default());

// Developers can now:
let mut component = query.get_mut(e).unwrap();
component.set_added();
*component = Component::default();
```
2. **Addition Timing Checks**:
```rust
if component.added() > last_check {
    // Handle new components
}
```
3. **Tick-based History**:
```rust
// Save/restore addition state
let original_add = component.added();
// ...operations...
component.set_last_added(original_add);
```

The changes maintain backward compatibility while expanding ECS capabilities with minimal overhead. Future improvements could include similar APIs for resource change detection.

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_ecs/src/change_detection.rs` (+60/-0)
Added new methods to complete the change detection API surface:

```rust
// Before: Existing changed methods only
pub trait DetectChanges {
    fn is_added(&self) -> bool;
    fn is_changed(&self) -> bool;
    fn set_changed(&mut self);
    fn set_last_changed(&mut self, last_change: Tick);
    // ...other existing methods...
}

// After: Added methods
pub trait DetectChanges {
    // Existing methods
    // ...
    
    /// Returns the tick recording the time this component was added
    fn added(&self) -> Tick;
    
    /// Manually flags this component as having been newly added
    fn set_added(&mut self);
    
    /// Manually sets the tick recording the time this component was added
    fn set_last_added(&mut self, last_added: Tick);
}
```

Implementation for `Mut<'_, T>`:
```rust
// Before: No added tick accessors
impl<T: Component> DetectChanges for Mut<'_, T> {
    // Existing changed implementations
}

// After: Full added API
impl<T: Component> DetectChanges for Mut<'_, T> {
    fn added(&self) -> Tick {
        self.ticks().added
    }

    fn set_added(&mut self) {
        self.ticks_mut().added = self.change_tick();
    }

    fn set_last_added(&mut self, last_added: Tick) {
        self.ticks_mut().added = last_added;
    }
    
    // Existing changed implementations remain
}
```

These changes complete the change detection API symmetry and enable new component management patterns.
