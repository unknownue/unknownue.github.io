## Description Translation
This reverts commit ac52cca033b351cc966cd3d40eb99ffbefbdb104.

Fixes #18815

# Objective

#18782 resulted in using `log` macros instead of `tracing` macros (in the interest of providing no_std support, specifically no_atomic support). That tradeoff isn't worth it, especially given that tracing is likely to get no_atomic support.

## Solution

Revert #18782

## The Story of This Pull Request

The PR addresses a regression introduced by #18782, which attempted to provide partial `no_std` support for Bevy's logging system by switching from `tracing` to `log` macros. While the original change aimed to support environments without atomic operations (no_atomic), it inadvertently removed critical functionality that Bevy systems expect from `tracing`.

The core issue stemmed from differing macro behaviors between `tracing` and `log`. Bevy's internal systems and third-party plugins often rely on `tracing`-specific features like structured logging and richer context propagation. The switch to `log` broke these expectations, as seen in #18815 where essential logging functionality became unavailable.

The revert decision weighed two factors:
1. The immediate need to maintain ecosystem compatibility
2. The likelihood of `tracing` gaining native `no_atomic` support

By reverting to `tracing`, the Bevy team prioritizes current functionality while banking on `tracing`'s roadmap to address the underlying `no_std` limitations. This approach avoids maintaining a forked logging implementation while waiting for upstream improvements.

Key technical considerations:
- `tracing` provides richer metadata and instrumentation
- Many Bevy systems assume `tracing`'s span-based logging
- `log` lacks native support for structured logging
- Atomic operations are only required for certain features in `tracing`

The implementation was a straightforward revert of the original PR's changes, primarily affecting:
1. Macro usage throughout the codebase
2. Dependency declarations in Cargo.toml files
3. Conditional compilation flags for `no_std` environments

```rust
// Before revert (using log macros)
use log::info;

// After revert (using tracing macros)
use tracing::info;
```

This change restores expected logging behavior while the community explores alternative approaches to `no_std` support that preserve `tracing` functionality.

## Key Files Changed

1. `crates/bevy_log/src/lib.rs` (+340/-22)
- Restored original `tracing`-based implementation
- Removed `log`-specific conditional logic
```rust
// Before:
#[cfg(feature = "log")]
fn some_logging_function() {
    log::info!("Message");
}

// After:
pub fn some_logging_function() {
    tracing::info!("Message");
}
```

2. `crates/bevy_log/src/plugin.rs` (+0/-344)
- Removed plugin implementation that depended on `log`
- Restored default logging initialization through `tracing`

3. `crates/bevy_log/Cargo.toml` (+13/-29)
- Reverted dependencies from `log` back to `tracing`
```toml
# Before:
[dependencies]
log = { version = "0.4", optional = true }

# After:
[dependencies]
tracing = { version = "0.1", features = ["std"] }
```

4. `crates/bevy_internal/Cargo.toml` (+6/-17)
- Restored `tracing-subscriber` dependency
- Removed conditional `log` features

5. `crates/bevy_gltf/Cargo.toml` (+0/-18)
- Removed unnecessary `log` dependency
