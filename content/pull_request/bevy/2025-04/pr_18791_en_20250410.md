## Description Translation
A clippy failure slipped into #18768, although I'm not sure why CI didn't catch it.

```sh
> cargo clippy --version
clippy 0.1.85 (4eb161250e 2025-03-15)

> cargo run -p ci
...
error: empty line after doc comment

## The Story of This Pull Request

### The Problem and Context
During routine development, a CI pipeline failure was observed locally when running `cargo clippy` on the Bevy engine's rendering code. The error stemmed from Rust's [empty_line_after_doc_comments] lint rule, which enforces proper documentation formatting. Specifically, line 106 in `light/mod.rs` contained an unintended blank line following a doc comment for the `PointLightShadowMap` struct.

While the previous PR (#18768) had passed CI checks, the author discovered that their local clippy configuration (version 0.1.85) flagged this formatting issue. This discrepancy suggested either a clippy version mismatch between local and CI environments or differences in lint configuration.

### The Solution Approach
The fix required straightforward documentation formatting correction:
1. Remove the empty line between doc comments
2. Maintain the technical content of the documentation
3. Ensure compliance with Rust's official style guidelines

The implementation took a minimal approach to avoid introducing any functional changes while resolving the linter error. No alternatives were considered since this was a direct style rule violation requiring simple formatting correction.

### The Implementation
The single-line modification addressed the clippy warning by eliminating the empty line between consecutive doc comments. This change preserved the documentation's semantic meaning while adhering to Rust's style requirements.

Before:
```rust
/// The width and height of each of the 6 faces of the cubemap.

/// The shadow map cube will be split into 6 faces of this size.
#[inline]
pub fn size(&self) -> u32 {
    self.size
}
```

After:
```rust
/// The width and height of each of the 6 faces of the cubemap.
/// The shadow map cube will be split into 6 faces of this size.
#[inline]
pub fn size(&self) -> u32 {
    self.size
}
```

### Technical Insights
The [empty_line_after_doc_comments] lint enforces two key rules:
1. No blank lines between consecutive `///` comments
2. Exactly one blank line between normal code and doc comments

This PR demonstrates the importance of:
- Consistent doc comment formatting for code readability
- Local development environment alignment with CI toolchains
- Understanding Rust's documentation conventions

### The Impact
This change:
1. Resolves clippy warnings for developers using newer lint versions
2. Maintains consistent documentation style across the codebase
3. Prevents potential future CI failures if clippy configurations update

Key technical lessons:
- Even minor formatting issues can break builds with strict linter configurations
- Documentation style is as critical as code style for maintenance
- Local and CI environment parity is crucial for consistent quality checks

## Key Files Changed

### `crates/bevy_pbr/src/light/mod.rs`
**Change**: Removed empty line between doc comments for `PointLightShadowMap`

Before:
```rust
/// The width and height of each of the 6 faces of the cubemap.

/// The shadow map cube will be split into 6 faces of this size.
```

After:
```rust
/// The width and height of each of the 6 faces of the cubemap.
/// The shadow map cube will be split into 6 faces of this size.
```

**Impact**: Resolves clippy lint warning while preserving documentation content
