## The Story of This Pull Request

This dependency update focuses on maintaining code quality through automated tooling. The Bevy project uses crate-ci/typos as part of its CI pipeline to catch spelling mistakes in the codebase. Version 1.31.1 of typos introduced a specific dictionary fix where it now detects and corrects the common misspelling "typ" to "type".

The update was automated through GitHub's Dependabot, which monitors dependency versions and creates PRs when updates are available. The trivial nature of this change (a patch version bump with a single dictionary entry) allowed for straightforward integration. The compatibility score of 100 indicated no breaking changes, making this a low-risk update.

The primary technical consideration was ensuring the spelling checker stays current with the latest pattern recognitions. While seemingly minor, consistent typo detection helps maintain professional code quality and prevents documentation errors. The update process demonstrates Bevy's commitment to automated code quality checks and timely dependency management.

**Purpose**: Update typos-action version in CI pipeline

```yaml
# Before:
- uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.31.0

# After:
- uses: crate-ci/typos@v1.31.1
```

This single-line change updates the version reference in GitHub Actions configuration, activating the new typo detection rules in all subsequent CI runs.
