# Quick Setup Guide for Automated WASM Builds

## ðŸš€ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` and `workflow`
4. Copy the generated token

### Step 2: Configure Source Repository
1. Go to `bevy_prototype_codex` repository
2. Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `DISPATCH_TOKEN`
5. Value: Your GitHub token from Step 1

### Step 3: Test the Setup
1. Go to `bevy_prototype_codex` â†’ Actions tab
2. Select "Trigger WASM Build" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"
4. Wait for completion (green checkmark)

### Step 4: Verify Results
1. Go to `unknownue.github.io` â†’ Actions tab
2. You should see "Auto Build and Deploy WASM Projects" running
3. Check the commit history for auto-generated commits

## âœ… You're Done!

The system is now fully automated:

- **Push code** to `bevy_prototype_codex` â†’ Automatic WASM build
- **Manual trigger** â†’ Run workflows manually
- **Weekly builds** â†’ Automatic updates every Sunday

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues

### "Repository not found" error
- Check if your GitHub token has access to both repositories
- Verify the token has `repo` and `workflow` permissions
- For private repositories, ensure `DISPATCH_TOKEN` is configured correctly

### Build timeouts
- Rust compilation can take 10+ minutes initially
- Subsequent builds are faster due to caching

### No changes detected
- The system only commits if files actually changed
- Check the workflow logs for details

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

- **Build status**: Check Actions tabs in both repositories
- **Build logs**: Click on workflow runs for detailed information
- **Generated files**: Check `content/projects/` in target repository

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Customize triggers**: Edit `paths` in trigger workflow to monitor different files
2. **Add notifications**: Configure GitHub notifications for build status
3. **Optimize builds**: Add caching for faster compilation times
