 Bevy has built-in [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) spans to make it cheap and easy to profile Bevy ECS systems, render logic, engine internals, and user app code. Enable the `trace` cargo feature to enable Bevy's built-in spans.
 
-If you also want to include `wgpu` tracing spans when profiling, they are emitted at the `tracing` `info` level so you will need to make sure they are not filtered out by the `LogSettings` resource's `filter` member which defaults to `wgpu=error`. You can do this by setting the `RUST_LOG=info` environment variable when running your application.
+Your tracing level needs to be at least `info` for this to work, so make sure that you don't set the `max_level(_release)_[warn/error]` features of the `tracing` crate nor filter it out using `LogPlugin`'s `filter` member. Note that `wgpu` and `naga` spans are filtered out by default. If you want to include them, you can either change your `LogPlugin`'s `filter` member or override it by setting the `RUST_LOG=info` environment variable when running your application.
 
 You also need to select a `tracing` backend using one of the cargo features described in the below sections.
