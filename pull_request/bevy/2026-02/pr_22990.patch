-The `bevy/bevy_picking` feature flag has been removed. This previously enabled picking functionality in `bevy_input_focus`,
-allowing users to select elements to focus using their mouse.
+The `bevy/bevy_picking` feature flag no longer enables `bevy_input_focus` picking functionality.
+For context, `bevy_input_focus` is inherently a `bevy_ui` related feature, allowing users to select UI elements to focus using their mouse.
 
-This is now exposed as part of the existing `bevy/bevy_ui_picking` feature, which is itself part of the `ui` feature collection.
+Instead, this functionality is now tied to the existing `bevy/ui_picking` feature, which is itself part of the `ui` feature collection.
 In most cases, you should add the `ui` feature collection to your project if you are using `bevy_ui`.
 
 If you want to enable `bevy_input_focus`'s picking functionality, but do *not* want to use `bevy_ui`, add a separate dependency to the same version of `bevy_input_focus` in your project and enable the optional `bevy_picking` feature there.
+
+This change means it now possible to enable `bevy_picking` without any assumptions about which backend in particular will be used.
